As we timidly stepped out, an empty Center Street stretched out before us.[pcms]

"It's been a while since the sun was this blinding."[pcms]

*45|
[fc]
The sky was clear, and the strong sunlight of the summer afternoon cast sharp[r]
shadows of the buildings on the asphalt.[pcms]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"But... this smell... It's terrible."[pcms]

*47|
[fc]
Kousuke muttered blankly as he surveyed the surroundings once more.[pcms]

*48|
[fc]
An uninhabited Shibuya... Yet, black smoke was rising from various places.[pcms]

*49|
[fc]
In the town of Shibuya, quieter than usual, only the bright BGM echoed emptily.[pcms]

*50|
[fc]
Between the sounds, the buzzing of insects could be heard, and a foul stench[r]
permeated the area...[pcms]

*51|
[fc]
The streets were littered with more trash than usual, but the source of this[r]
smell wasn't such things...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j10"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*52|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren1307"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Hii... huu..."[pcms]
;//＠おびえて

*53|
[fc]
With a small scream, Ren clung to me.[pcms]

*54|
[fc]
Looking down, she was staring at her feet and trembling.[pcms]

*55|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...ugh..."[pcms]

*56|
[fc]
There were stains on the road that seemed to be bloodstains.[pcms]

*57|
[fc]
Not just that, but there were dead rats, dead crows... All scattered about as if[r]
they had been torn apart.[pcms]

*58|
[fc]
Furthermore, among the bones...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*59|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1449"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Hii!? A-are those... h-human bones?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a12"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*60|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1283"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...It seems so."[pcms]

*61|
[fc]
There were clearly recognizable human bones among them.[pcms]

*62|
[fc]
Some were almost completely intact like skeletal specimens, but like the animal[r]
corpses, they were torn apart and scattered.[pcms]

*63|
[fc]
The remains with guts spilling out or flesh violently ripped off looked like[r]
finished fried chicken.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*64|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1284"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Everyone, be careful. Make sure not to touch anything."[pcms]

*65|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai showed a handkerchief in her hand while swatting away the swarming[r]
flies.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*66|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1285"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Also, just to be safe, let's cover our mouths with a handkerchief or towel."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f10"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*67|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Yeah, that's right... Just looking at it makes me feel like I could catch a[r]
disease..."[pcms]

*68|
[fc]
Following the senior's example, everyone covered their mouths with towels or[r]
handkerchiefs.[pcms]

[vo_ren s="ren1308"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"O-Onii-chan..."[pcms]
;//＠おびえと不安

*70|
[fc]
Hugging Ren's shoulder as she clung to me in fear, I gently turned her face[r]
away.[pcms]

*71|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"You don't need to look, Ren."[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*72|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren1309"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Okay..."[pcms]

*73|
[fc]
Staring only at her feet, Ren pressed on desperately, leaning on me for support.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b15"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*74|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1450"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"...No one should die like this..."[pcms]
;//＠悲しそう

*75|
[fc]
Yuuho muttered softly to herself.[pcms]

*76|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"How did these people... die?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f11"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*77|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"How? They were probably eaten... Or maybe taken out by a virus, right?"[pcms]

*78|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah, but... The bodies here aren't just human, right? There are crows and rats[r]
too..."[pcms]

*79|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I wonder if people infected with it start eating animals too..."[pcms]

*80|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai listened to our conversation without changing her stern expression[r]
and joined in.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*81|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1286"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...Cannibalism is also a possibility."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f10"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*82|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Geh! Cannibalism?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*83|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1287"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"The infected attacked their own kind, humans. By that logic, it wouldn't be[r]
strange if infected rats and crows also ate each other..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*84|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1288"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"But that's just speculation."[pcms]

*85|
[fc]
Everyone shuddered at her somber voice.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*86|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1451"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"...I'm starting to lose my appetite."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*87|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren1310"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Onii-chan!"[pcms]
;//＠緊張と驚き、ちょっと恐怖

*88|
[fc]
Suddenly stopping, Ren tugged at my sleeve.[pcms]

*89|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"What's wrong, Ren? Are you feeling sick?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*90|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren1311"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"No, it's not that. I-I just got a message... From Dad..."[pcms]

*91|
[fc]
Ren showed me my cell phone that she had been keeping safe.[pcms]

*92|
[fc]
I quickly scanned the text.[pcms]

*93|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...! A swarm of crows!?"[pcms]

*94|
[fc]
The message from Dad was about a heliport near Chiba Mouse-Kingdom being[r]
attacked by a swarm of crows.[pcms]

*95|
[fc]
It was written in an unusually short message, telling us to be careful not only[r]
of them but also of the crows.[pcms]

*96|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Anyway, let's reply, Ren."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*97|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren1312"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Y-yeah."[pcms]

*98|
[fc]
"Please reply when it's safe," Ren typed quickly and sent the email.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f11"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*99|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"A flock of crows, huh."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*100|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1289"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"That's right... So far, we haven't seen any animals that seem to be infected."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*101|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"If we haven't seen 'em, it means they're not here either."[pcms]

*102|
[fc]
I realized something anew from Kousuke's words.[pcms]

*103|
[fc]
Indeed, since a while ago, all we've seen are corpses... The only things moving[r]
are the annoying flies.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*104|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1452"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"...Does that mean what Wataru said about the infected's lifespan coming to an[r]
end?"[pcms]

*105|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I hope that's the case..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*106|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1290"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"No, that's not necessarily true."[pcms]

*107|
[fc]
The senior's voice tightened our nearly relaxed feelings.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*108|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1291"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"If it were a matter of lifespan, there should be bodies that simply collapsed.[r]
The fact that all the bodies have been ravaged suggests that those who fed on[r]
them are still around."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*109|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1292"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Let's not let our guard down and continue to be vigilant."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*110|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Ugh, this is tough. Not only them, but if I have to worry about rats and crows[r]
too, my delicate nerves won't last."[pcms]

*111|
[fc]
Trying to lighten the mood or perhaps deliberately reacting cheerfully, Kousuke[r]
suddenly stopped talking mid-sentence.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f10"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*112|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Like..."[pcms]

*113|
[fc]
His face looked as if he suddenly realized something, and he started running[r]
down the street.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*114|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1453"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Kousuke?"[pcms]

*115|
[fc]
Kousuke stopped and slowly picked something up.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a7"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*116|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1293"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Don't touch it carelessly; you might get infected!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*117|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"..."[pcms]
;//＠怒りと悲しみ

*118|
[fc]
Ignoring Maruko-senpai's warning, Kousuke kept his gaze fixed on what was in his[r]
hand.[pcms]

*119|
[fc]
What he was holding was... a bloodstained vigilante's cap...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a16"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*120|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1294"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"What does this mean?"[pcms]

*121|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's the cap of the town's vigilantes. Kousuke also volunteered to join[r]
them... So, probably... one of his comrades..."[pcms]

*122|
[fc]
As I explained to the puzzled senior, I found myself at a loss for words.[pcms]

*123|
[fc]
Kousuke's comrade had died... Someone he saw every day...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*124|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1454"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Kousuke..."[pcms]
;//＠声をかけたいが何を言えばいいか分からない

*125|
[fc]
Even though Yuuho called out to him, she seemed at a loss for what to say next,[r]
her words trailing off.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*126|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"...Let's go."[pcms]

*127|
[fc]
In a quiet tone that conveyed sadness and anger, Kousuke murmured slowly.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f11"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*128|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"We need to check out the town..."[pcms]

*129|
[fc]
With the cap still in hand, Kousuke started walking.[pcms]

*130|
[fc]
Despite the dangerous blood on it, even Maruko-senpai didn't try to stop him.[pcms]

*131|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Ren, can you still walk? Are you okay?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*132|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren1313"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yeah. My fever has gone down; I'm fine."[pcms]

*133|
[fc]
We slowly followed behind Kousuke.[pcms]
