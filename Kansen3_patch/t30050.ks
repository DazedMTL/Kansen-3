Bewildered by Yuuho's tears, I found myself unable to say anything.[pcms]

While wiping her tears, Yuuho tries her best to smile.[pcms]

"No... It is my fault."[pcms]

*6294|

Suddenly, my chest fills with a sense of guilt.[pcms]

*6295|
[fc]
The apology earlier was for the clumsy kiss. But this "sorry" is different...[pcms]

hurting Yuuho...[pcms]

If it was all just in my head, and I've been sulking and jealous and troubled[r]
