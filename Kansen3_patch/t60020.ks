I rushed into the DJ bar, panting, after receiving the news.[pcms]

*7338|
[fc]
Everyone was already gathered, silently engrossed in the[r]
television.[pcms]

*7339|
[fc]
The usual male announcer was on the screen, but his[r]
expression was stiff with fear, and he was sweating[r]
profusely...[pcms]

*7340|
[fc]
What's going on? What's happening...!?[pcms]

"...I will repeat the information, please listen! This is a[r]

It's Dad! He was in the middle of a live broadcast.[pcms]

"Eh!? O...Dad!?"[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*7345|

Ren let out a scream and nearly collapsed.[pcms]

*7346|
[fc]
I suppressed my own urge to shout and supported Ren,[r]
desperately listening to the voice coming from the TV.[pcms]

[ns]Father[nse]
"The initial confirmation of the infected was delayed, and[r]
we failed to secure the facility. The number has rapidly[r]
increased, and now almost everyone in the facility has[r]
turned into an infected!"[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=141 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"Currently, the survivors have barricaded themselves inside[r]
the facility and are waiting for rescue from the Self-[r]
Defense Forces, but we can't communicate with each other![r]
Immediate rescue is desperately needed!!"[pcms]

*7349|
[fc]
The content was terrifying, and Dad's voice was quite tense,[r]
but he spoke calmly and composedly.[pcms]

*7350|
[fc]
Maybe Dad is the only one who managed to hide somewhere out[r]
of their reach...[pcms]

*7351|
[fc]
[ns]Announcer[nse]
"Mr. Ayase. Where are you right now?"[pcms]

*7352|
[fc]
The announcer seemed to regain his composure after hearing[r]
Dad's voice and began to speak.[pcms]

"I'm at the press center inside the facility! This room is[r]
prepared for journalists from various companies, and the[r]
gathered reporters are exchanging information while planning[r]
their next steps..."[pcms]

*7354|

Suddenly, Dad's voice cut off, followed by sounds like[r]
something breaking one after another.[pcms]

[ns]Announcer[nse]
"Mr. Ayase!? What happened, Mr. Ayase!?"[pcms]

*7358|
[fc]
Sounds of objects colliding and men shouting at each other[r]
could be heard behind the live audio.[pcms]

[ns]Father[nse]
"...Wataru, Ren, are you listening?"[pcms]

*7361|
[fc]
His tone changed drastically... It was Dad's usual voice for[r]
family, not his professional one.[pcms]

"And then..."[pcms]

*7365|
[fc]
Behind Dad's voice, everyone was screaming. There were cries[r]
and shouts, and voices saying "They're inside!!"[pcms]

*7366|
[fc]
Suddenly, all too abruptly, the live audio cut off with a[r]
"click."[pcms]

*7367|
[fc]
[ns]Announcer[nse]
"Mr. Ayase... Mr. Ayase senpaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!"[pcms]

to struggle within my arms.[pcms]
