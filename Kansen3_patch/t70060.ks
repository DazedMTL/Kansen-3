In my arms, Ren was shaking all over, crying. I silently[r]
stroked her back, continued to pat her head, and held her[r]
tight.[pcms]

*7818|
[fc]
In the dimly lit room, only Ren's sobbing echoed quietly.[r]
The trembling of Ren's body in my arms spoke volumes of her[r]
sorrow.[pcms]

I wonder how much time has passed. Eventually, Ren's sobbing[r]
stopped, and her trembling ceased. Her slight weight was[r]
entrusted to my body.[pcms]

*7820|
[fc]
Ren had fallen asleep exhausted from crying. I gently laid[r]
her body on the futon and quietly left the room.[pcms]

After leaving the room, I headed towards the drink bar. I[r]
just wanted to quench my thirst with anything. Something was[r]
stuck in my throat. I wanted to drink it down.[pcms]

Everyone was voicing their concern for me. Honestly, if I[r]
just cried out loud, I might feel better.[pcms]

*7835|

But I couldn't worry everyone any more than this. I didn't[r]
want to show such a pathetic sight to everyone.[pcms]

I said that and went back towards the room, feeling[r]
everyone's lingering gazes on my back...[pcms]

I remember passing by the room. But before I knew it, I[r]
found myself standing in the 7th floor backyard.[pcms]

*7839|
[fc]
Maybe subconsciously, I was looking for a place where I[r]
could be alone. That's right... right now, it's just me[r]
here.[pcms]

*7840|
[fc]
The lump in my throat that water couldn't wash down. The[r]
lump called sorrow overflowed now that I was alone, unable[r]
to be held back.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ugh... uuh..."[pcms]

*7842|
[fc]
Dad... Dad! I wanted you to be alive. I thought you'd come[r]
to pick us up with your usual joking smile.[pcms]

*7843|
[fc]
We'd run up to each other and embrace, like a reunion scene[r]
from a drama. That's what I thought we'd laugh about[r]
together.[pcms]

*7844|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Uuh... kuh... Dad..."[pcms]

*7845|
[fc]
We weren't blood-related, but you were no different from a[r]
real father to me. No, I respected you even more than that,[r]
Dad.[pcms]

*7846|
[fc]
I should have told you while you were still alive. I never[r]
thought that suddenly, like Mom, Dad would be taken away[r]
from me so abruptly.[pcms]

*7847|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Uuh... Dad..."[pcms]

*7848|
[fc]
Dad... it's okay... I'll do my best. I'll make sure to[r]
protect Ren. For both of us. Just let me cry for a little[r]
bit now... then I'll really do my best.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ugh... ugh..."[pcms]

*7850|
[fc]
"Take care of Ren for me, Wataru."[pcms]

*7851|
[fc]
I felt like I could hear Dad's voice. Ah... that's right.[r]
It's about time to go back to the room. Ren might have woken[r]
up by now.[pcms]

*7852|
[fc]
I decided to go back to the room after wiping my cheeks dry.[pcms]

"...! Yuuho?"[pcms]

*7855|
[fc]
Yuuho was standing quietly in the shadow of the corridor. I[r]
hadn't noticed at all... She must have seen me crying[r]
pathetically.[pcms]

*7856|
[fc]
Yuuho also seemed to have a slightly awkward expression on[r]
her face. She might have been watching me the whole time.[pcms]

then I missed the chance to call out to you..."[pcms]

"...It's okay, Yuuho. Thank you for worrying about me. But[r]
I'm fine now. I'm just a bit tired so I'll go back to my[r]
room and rest. You should rest too."[pcms]

*7860|
[fc]
While putting on a brave front, I didn't want Yuuho to see[r]
any more of my pathetic state, so I turned my face away[r]
slightly as I tried to pass by her side.[pcms]

hugged me![pcms]

"Wataru! Please, don't push yourself. Don't hold back. Let[r]

"Wataru, you don't have to be strong at a time like this.[r]
Please, cry as much as you need to ease your feelings. Okay,[r]
Wataru? Please, Wataru."[pcms]

*7865|
[fc]
With a voice as if squeezing out the words, almost shouting,[r]
Yuuho hugged me. Yuuho's face looked worried, and a single[r]
tear rolled down her cheek. Yuuho was crying for me.[pcms]

*7866|
[fc]
The moment I saw that tear, the emotions I thought had[r]
settled came rushing back.[pcms]

want to cry, it's better to cry a lot."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"*sob sob sob*... Dad... Dad! Wahhh!!"[pcms]

*7870|
[fc]
While clinging to Yuuho who was hugging me, I raised my[r]
voice and continued to cry, indulging in Yuuho's kindness.[pcms]
