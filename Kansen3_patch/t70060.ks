In my arms, Ren was shaking all over, crying. I silently stroked her back,[r]
continued to pat her head, and held her tight.[pcms]

*7818|
[fc]
In the dimly lit room, only Ren's sobbing echoed quietly. The trembling of Ren's[r]
body in my arms spoke volumes of her sorrow.[pcms]

I wonder how much time has passed. Eventually, Ren's sobbing stopped, and her[r]
trembling ceased. Her slight weight was entrusted to my body.[pcms]

*7820|
[fc]
Ren had fallen asleep exhausted from crying. I gently laid her body on the futon[r]
and quietly left the room.[pcms]

After leaving the room, I headed towards the drink bar. I just wanted to quench[r]
my thirst with anything. Something was stuck in my throat. I wanted to drink it[r]
down.[pcms]

Everyone was voicing their concern for me. Honestly, if I just cried out loud, I[r]
might feel better.[pcms]

*7835|
[fc]
But I couldn't worry everyone any more than this. I didn't want to show such a[r]
pathetic sight to everyone.[pcms]

I said that and went back towards the room, feeling everyone's lingering gazes[r]
on my back...[pcms]

I remember passing by the room. But before I knew it, I found myself standing in[r]
the 7th floor backyard.[pcms]

*7839|
[fc]
Maybe subconsciously, I was looking for a place where I could be alone. That's[r]
right... right now, it's just me here.[pcms]

*7840|
[fc]
The lump in my throat that water couldn't wash down. The lump called sorrow[r]
overflowed now that I was alone, unable to be held back.[pcms]

"Ugh... uuh..."[pcms]

*7842|
[fc]
Dad... Dad! I wanted you to be alive. I thought you'd come to pick us up with[r]
your usual joking smile.[pcms]

*7843|
[fc]
We'd run up to each other and embrace, like a reunion scene from a drama. That's[r]
what I thought we'd laugh about together.[pcms]

*7844|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Uuh... kuh... Dad..."[pcms]

*7845|
[fc]
We weren't blood-related, but you were no different from a real father to me.[r]
No, I respected you even more than that, Dad.[pcms]

*7846|
[fc]
I should have told you while you were still alive. I never thought that[r]
suddenly, like Mom, Dad would be taken away from me so abruptly.[pcms]

*7847|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Uuh... Dad..."[pcms]

*7848|
[fc]
Dad... it's okay... I'll do my best. I'll make sure to protect Ren. For both of[r]
us. Just let me cry for a little bit now... then I'll really do my best.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ugh... ugh..."[pcms]

*7850|
[fc]
"Take care of Ren for me, Wataru."[pcms]

*7851|
[fc]
I felt like I could hear Dad's voice. Ah... that's right. It's about time to go[r]
back to the room. Ren might have woken up by now.[pcms]

*7852|
[fc]
I decided to go back to the room after wiping my cheeks dry.[pcms]

Yuuho was standing quietly in the shadow of the corridor. I hadn't noticed at[r]
all... She must have seen me crying pathetically.[pcms]

*7856|
[fc]
Yuuho also seemed to have a slightly awkward expression on her face. She might[r]
have been watching me the whole time.[pcms]

just a bit tired so I'll go back to my room and rest. You should rest too."[pcms]

*7860|
[fc]
While putting on a brave front, I didn't want Yuuho to see any more of my[r]
pathetic state, so I turned my face away slightly as I tried to pass by her[r]
side.[pcms]

you need to ease your feelings. Okay, Wataru? Please, Wataru."[pcms]

*7865|
[fc]
With a voice as if squeezing out the words, almost shouting, Yuuho hugged me.[r]
Yuuho's face looked worried, and a single tear rolled down her cheek. Yuuho was[r]
crying for me.[pcms]

*7866|
[fc]
The moment I saw that tear, the emotions I thought had settled came rushing[r]
back.[pcms]

"*sob sob sob*... Dad... Dad! Wahhh!!"[pcms]

*7870|

While clinging to Yuuho who was hugging me, I raised my voice and continued to[r]
cry, indulging in Yuuho's kindness.[pcms]
