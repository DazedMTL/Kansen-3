How much time has passed since then...?[pcms]

*5421|
[fc]
I've been holed up in my room on the 5th floor, crying[r]
continuously. My eyes and throat are stinging and painful.[r]
But more than that, the pain in my heart feels like it's[r]
going to tear me apart.[pcms]

*5422|
[fc]
Yuuho's body was wrapped in a blanket and buried in the same[r]
place as the Masters. I'm sorry for leaving you alone in[r]
that dark, cold refrigerator... But maybe being with your[r]
beloved Masters will bring you some comfort...[pcms]

*5423|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's just... self-deception..."[pcms]

*5424|
[fc]
Yuuho can't feel anything anymore. She can't have any[r]
emotions. Because... I... I shot Yuuho with these hands.[pcms]

*5425|
[fc]
I took her life... I erased Yuuho's existence from this[r]
world... Undoubtedly, it was me.[pcms]

*5426|
[fc]
The Yuuho I loved so much... Probably, I was in love with[r]
Yuuho... Yet, I could only express my feelings through an[r]
act opposite of love...[pcms]

*5427|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... forgive me... uuu..."[pcms]

*5428|
[fc]
I should have protected her. I intended to protect her no[r]
matter what. And yet, with the gun entrusted to me by[r]
Tadahiko, I...![pcms]

*5429|
[fc]
Far from protecting her... I killed her...[pcms]

*5430|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yuuho... Yuu-ho... uuuooooh...!"[pcms]

*5431|
[fc]
If that gun had been within reach, I would have shot myself[r]
in the chest without hesitation.[pcms]

*5432|
[fc]
But perhaps anticipating that, Tadahiko's gun was taken away[r]
by Senior Maruko.[pcms]

*5433|
[fc]
I tear at my hair and beat my chest over and over. If I[r]
couldn't kill myself, I wanted to at least inflict some[r]
wounds as a substitute.[pcms]

*5434|
[fc]
What kind of punishment would absolve me of my sins? What[r]
kind of pain must I endure to understand Yuuho's pain...?[pcms]

But right now, I don't want to talk to anyone. Not comfort,[r]
not sympathy, not understanding. I didn't want to receive[r]
anything.[pcms]

The call that had once stopped started ringing again.[r]
Reluctantly, I picked up the phone to the incessant sound.[pcms]

It was from Mizuki when I checked the display.[pcms]

Mizuki's scream, loud enough to burst my eardrums, pulled me[r]
back to reality.[pcms]
