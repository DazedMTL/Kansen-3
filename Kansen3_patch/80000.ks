The lunch menu consisted of rice, miso soup, meat and[r]

It seems that Yuuho and Ren were eager to cook since they[r]

Looking over, I saw that in front of Jin-san was a plate of[r]
vegetable stir-fry without the meat.[pcms]

The special meat and vegetable stir-fry from Kannagi-ken has[r]
a great crunchy texture from the vegetables soaked in meat[r]
juices; it's one of my favorite dishes too...[pcms]

I wonder if it's still good without the meat...?[pcms]

Last night we talked and I saw an unexpected side of her[r]

To tell the truth, I also felt a little desire to have[r]
Senior Maruko all to myself. Maybe we could have a nice[r]
atmosphere like last night...[pcms]

the VIP room laden with bottles of liquor, snacks,[r]
magazines, and more. Even after eating so much lunch, is his[r]

I was really worried, and also felt disappointed that I came[r]

probably hasn't gone too far.[pcms]

What should I do? I really want to see Senior's face.[pcms]

*72|
[fc]
Should I just wait in the room? But then again, I have no[r]
idea when Senior will come back...[pcms]

Everyone else is probably exploring shops they're interested[r]
