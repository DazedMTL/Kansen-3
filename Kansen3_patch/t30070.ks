Without saying anything, Yuuho tilted her head quizzically[r]
and removed her earphones.[pcms]

"...What's wrong? Wataru...?"[pcms]

*6402|
[fc]
Damn it...!!! Could it be that just now was the moment for a[r]
kiss...???[pcms]

*6403|
[fc]
I realized it, but it was too late. The magical moment of[r]
our gazes meeting had already passed, and Yuuho was just[r]
smiling brightly as usual...[pcms]

*6404|
[fc]
I let slip the greatest chance God had given me... I am the[r]
biggest fool in Japan...[pcms]

*6405|
[fc]
Feeling quite downhearted, I thought to comfort Yuuho, which[r]
was my original intention.[pcms]

"N-no, it's nothing... Are you okay, Yuuho?"[pcms]

"About your family, and stuff... You've been having a tough[r]

When I asked hesitantly, Yuuho looked up at the sky.[pcms]

"...Well, yeah. But... there's no point in worrying about[r]
it."[pcms]

*6411|

Her carefree response didn't seem to carry any sense of[r]
tragedy.[pcms]

*6412|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yuuho..."[pcms]

*6413|
[fc]
The sight of Yuuho acting strong in front of others but[r]
succumbing to loneliness when alone was painful to see.[pcms]

*6414|
[fc]
I wish she would be honest with me... It's okay to cry in[r]
front of me... Or maybe... am I just not good enough...?[pcms]

*6415|
[fc]
Not knowing what to make of the silence, Yuuho gave a bright[r]
smile.[pcms]

Yuuho's eyes were gentle as she chuckled. It was as if she[r]
was blessing Kousuke and Mizuki, yet also as if she was[r]
watching the end of the world...[pcms]

Suddenly, my phone rang and I jumped in surprise. When I[r]
