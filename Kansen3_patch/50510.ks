I remembered something unpleasant. But now, all I can do is[r]
pray for the souls of Master and Mama...[pcms]

*3012|
[fc]
...No, I should forget it. I can't keep dwelling on it[r]
forever.[pcms]

*3013|
[fc]
I'll cool my head at my favorite spot. That way, surely... I[r]
can forget, even if just for a while.[pcms]

*3014|
[fc]
Dragging my feet as if they were wrapped in lead, I head to[r]
my favorite place.[pcms]

*3015|
[fc]
To get to the rooftop, I have to go through the backyard.[r]
That's where Mama used to pass through.[pcms]

*3016|
[fc]
Once again, memories of Master and the others flit through[r]
my mind.[pcms]

*3017|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`I mustn't think about it... I need to forget. Lock it away[r]
deep inside my heart...[pcms]

*3018|
[fc]
I tell myself this, shaking my head to dispel the unpleasant[r]
memories.[pcms]

*3019|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Huh... Jin...?[pcms]

*3020|
[fc]
Jin was sitting in the same seat as before, leaning against[r]
the wall and sleeping.[pcms]

*3021|
[fc]
The only difference was that a blanket was now draped over[r]
his body. Mizuki probably thoughtfully covered him.[pcms]

*3022|
[fc]
Around Jin's seat were ice pails and bottles of alcohol[r]
carelessly placed, suggesting he had drunk quite a bit.[pcms]

*3023|
[fc]
Huh? There are two glasses... Someone was drinking with him.[pcms]

*3024|
[fc]
But who could it have been? Curious, I look around and see[r]
Maruko-senpai sitting near the entrance to the terrace,[r]
gazing outside.[pcms]

*3025|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Have you been awake all this time...?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3026|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1608"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`Hmm...? Wataru, is that you?[pcms]

*3027|
[fc]
Perhaps she heard my muttering, as Maruko-senpai slowly[r]
turned around.[pcms]

*3028|
[fc]
As she turned back, Maruko-senpai's blonde hair was[r]
illuminated by the moonlight, shimmering like silk threads[r]
and captivating my gaze.[pcms]

*3029|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Ma... no...[pcms]

*3030|
[fc]
That's right... Jin is sleeping nearby. If I raise my voice[r]
here, I'll wake him up...[pcms]

*3031|
[fc]
He seems scary when angry, and more than that, I feel guilty[r]
for potentially waking someone who is finally resting, so I[r]
quietly approach Maruko-senpai and sit down next to her.[pcms]

*3032|
[fc]
Turning her gaze away from me and back to the night view,[r]
Maruko-senpai's profile and reflection in the glass are as[r]
beautiful as a doll's, mesmerizing to behold.[pcms]

*3033|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1609"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`Did you need something from me?[pcms]

*3034|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Ah... no... It's not like that. Have you been awake this[r]
whole time, senpai?[pcms]

*3035|
[fc]
Both Maruko-senpai and I continue our conversation in a[r]
strange state, staring at our reflections in the glass and[r]
at each other.[pcms]

*3036|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1610"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`I did fall asleep once, but woke up soon after and couldn't[r]
get back to sleep. I've always been a light sleeper...[pcms]

*3037|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1611"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`What about you, Wataru?[pcms]

*3038|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`I was heading to my favorite spot...[pcms]

*3039|
[fc]
I lift up the blanket I was carrying to show her.[pcms]

*3040|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`I was thinking of going to the place with the sign on this[r]
building. No one will scold me now, and the view is nice, so[r]
I thought it might clear my head.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3041|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1612"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`Hmm, there's such a place? I'm curious... But it seems[r]
better to refrain tonight.[pcms]

*3042|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Why? It's not raining, and there isn't much wind...[pcms]

*3043|
[fc]
Before I could finish speaking, Maruko-senpai stood up and[r]
opened the glass door to the terrace.[pcms]

*3044|
[fc]
Then, along with a warm and gentle breeze, an indescribable[r]
smell wafted ina sour smell like rotting garbageand that[r]
eerie, hair-raising voice came through.[pcms]

*3045|
[fc]
It seemed like a considerable number of people were[r]
wandering around, their groans swirling and echoing[r]
throughout the city.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3046|

[vo_mar s="maru1613"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`They might be nocturnal creatures. Or perhaps they can't[r]
give up on us...[pcms]

*3047|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1614"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`I also tried to go out on the terrace but... In any case,[r]
this won't do.[pcms]

*3048|
[fc]
Indeed, in such a state, I couldn't feel like gazing at the[r]
stars. Instead of clearing my mood as intended, I only felt[r]
enveloped by discomfort.[pcms]

*3049|
[fc]
And what a terrifying voice it is. Being inside LASERa safe[r]
boxI had forgotten that just one step outside lies hell.[pcms]

*3050|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`...This is disappointing...[pcms]

*3051|
[fc]
My mood deflated. Being barred from going outside and[r]
hearing that voice made my spirits plummet further.[pcms]

*3052|
[fc]
Driven by a desire to abandon everything, I collapsed[r]
powerlessly on the spot.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f27"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_mar s="maru1615"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`Hmph... Wretches... I wish I could ease their suffering a[r]
bit...[pcms]

*3054|
[fc]
In stark contrast to me, Maruko-senpai stood in front of the[r]
door with a stern expression, made the sign of the cross[r]
over her chest, and began murmuring in a low voice.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f24"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

`The wrath of the Lord of Hosts scorches the earth; its[r]
inhabitants wither like tinder; none spare their brothers or[r]
sisters. They snatch on the right but remain hungry; they[r]
devour on the left but are not satisfied.[pcms]

Humans eating humans. It's truly hell.[pcms]

*3058|
[fc]
Perhaps this city has become like what Maruko-senpai[r]
recited.[pcms]

*3059|
[fc]
Hell... huh...[pcms]

*3060|
[fc]
The rest was too difficult for me to understand. But I got[r]
the last part; it sounded familiar. I must have heard it[r]
somewhere before.[pcms]

*3061|

So, this is...[pcms]

"The time of the final judgment?"[pcms]

"When the world's chaos reaches its limit, and iniquity and[r]
immorality are rampant, many angels and the Lord Himself[r]
will descend from heaven to punish all sinners."[pcms]

*3069|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1623"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"It is said that at that time, so many sinners will be cast[r]
into hell that the dead will overflow from hell and begin to[r]
walk the earth... To me, the infected look just like that."[pcms]

*3070|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*3071|
[fc]
Indeed, the infected who wriggle only for their desires[r]
without feeling pain or joy from their wounds do seem like[r]
the undead from hell.[pcms]

other reasons, I can't shake off the fear of them."[pcms]

A curse...? Could it be a punishment for the arrogant[r]

The moans heard throughout the city bring my spirits down.[r]
And it's suffocating.[pcms]
