I remembered something unpleasant. But now, all I can do is pray for the souls[r]
of Master and Mama...[pcms]

*3012|
[fc]
...No, I should forget it. I can't keep dwelling on it forever.[pcms]

*3013|
[fc]
I'll cool my head at my favorite spot. That way, surely... I can forget, even if[r]
just for a while.[pcms]

*3014|
[fc]
Dragging my feet as if they were wrapped in lead, I head to my favorite place.[pcms]

*3015|
[fc]
To get to the rooftop, I have to go through the backyard. That's where Mama used[r]
to pass through.[pcms]

*3016|
[fc]
Once again, memories of Master and the others flit through my mind.[pcms]

*3017|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`I mustn't think about it... I need to forget. Lock it away deep inside my[r]
heart...[pcms]

*3018|
[fc]
I tell myself this, shaking my head to dispel the unpleasant memories.[pcms]

*3019|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Huh... Jin...?[pcms]

*3020|
[fc]
Jin was sitting in the same seat as before, leaning against the wall and[r]
sleeping.[pcms]

*3021|
[fc]
The only difference was that a blanket was now draped over his body. Mizuki[r]
probably thoughtfully covered him.[pcms]

*3022|
[fc]
Around Jin's seat were ice pails and bottles of alcohol carelessly placed,[r]
suggesting he had drunk quite a bit.[pcms]

*3023|
[fc]
Huh? There are two glasses... Someone was drinking with him.[pcms]

*3024|
[fc]
But who could it have been? Curious, I look around and see Maruko-senpai sitting[r]
near the entrance to the terrace, gazing outside.[pcms]

*3025|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Have you been awake all this time...?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3026|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1608"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`Hmm...? Wataru, is that you?[pcms]

*3027|
[fc]
Perhaps she heard my muttering, as Maruko-senpai slowly turned around.[pcms]

*3028|
[fc]
As she turned back, Maruko-senpai's blonde hair was illuminated by the[r]
moonlight, shimmering like silk threads and captivating my gaze.[pcms]

*3029|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Ma... no...[pcms]

*3030|
[fc]
That's right... Jin is sleeping nearby. If I raise my voice here, I'll wake him[r]
up...[pcms]

*3031|
[fc]
He seems scary when angry, and more than that, I feel guilty for potentially[r]
waking someone who is finally resting, so I quietly approach Maruko-senpai and[r]
sit down next to her.[pcms]

*3032|
[fc]
Turning her gaze away from me and back to the night view, Maruko-senpai's[r]
profile and reflection in the glass are as beautiful as a doll's, mesmerizing to[r]
behold.[pcms]

*3033|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1609"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`Did you need something from me?[pcms]

*3034|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Ah... no... It's not like that. Have you been awake this whole time, senpai?[pcms]

*3035|
[fc]
Both Maruko-senpai and I continue our conversation in a strange state, staring[r]
at our reflections in the glass and at each other.[pcms]

*3036|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1610"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`I did fall asleep once, but woke up soon after and couldn't get back to sleep.[r]
I've always been a light sleeper...[pcms]

*3037|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1611"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`What about you, Wataru?[pcms]

*3038|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`I was heading to my favorite spot...[pcms]

*3039|
[fc]
I lift up the blanket I was carrying to show her.[pcms]

*3040|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`I was thinking of going to the place with the sign on this building. No one[r]
will scold me now, and the view is nice, so I thought it might clear my head.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3041|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1612"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`Hmm, there's such a place? I'm curious... But it seems better to refrain[r]
tonight.[pcms]

*3042|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`Why? It's not raining, and there isn't much wind...[pcms]

*3043|
[fc]
Before I could finish speaking, Maruko-senpai stood up and opened the glass door[r]
to the terrace.[pcms]

*3044|
[fc]
Then, along with a warm and gentle breeze, an indescribable smell wafted ina[r]
sour smell like rotting garbageand that eerie, hair-raising voice came through.[pcms]

*3045|
[fc]
It seemed like a considerable number of people were wandering around, their[r]
groans swirling and echoing throughout the city.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3046|

[vo_mar s="maru1613"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`They might be nocturnal creatures. Or perhaps they can't give up on us...[pcms]

*3047|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1614"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`I also tried to go out on the terrace but... In any case, this won't do.[pcms]

*3048|
[fc]
Indeed, in such a state, I couldn't feel like gazing at the stars. Instead of[r]
clearing my mood as intended, I only felt enveloped by discomfort.[pcms]

*3049|
[fc]
And what a terrifying voice it is. Being inside LASERa safe boxI had forgotten[r]
that just one step outside lies hell.[pcms]

*3050|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
`...This is disappointing...[pcms]

*3051|
[fc]
My mood deflated. Being barred from going outside and hearing that voice made my[r]
spirits plummet further.[pcms]

*3052|
[fc]
Driven by a desire to abandon everything, I collapsed powerlessly on the spot.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f27"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3053|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1615"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
`Hmph... Wretches... I wish I could ease their suffering a bit...[pcms]

*3054|
[fc]
In stark contrast to me, Maruko-senpai stood in front of the door with a stern[r]
expression, made the sign of the cross over her chest, and began murmuring in a[r]
low voice.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f24"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

`The wrath of the Lord of Hosts scorches the earth; its inhabitants wither like[r]
tinder; none spare their brothers or sisters. They snatch on the right but[r]
remain hungry; they devour on the left but are not satisfied.[pcms]

[vo_mar s="maru1617"]

Humans eating humans. It's truly hell.[pcms]

*3058|
[fc]
Perhaps this city has become like what Maruko-senpai recited.[pcms]

*3059|
[fc]
Hell... huh...[pcms]

*3060|
[fc]
The rest was too difficult for me to understand. But I got the last part; it[r]
sounded familiar. I must have heard it somewhere before.[pcms]

*3061|

So, this is...[pcms]

that, the unpleasant words 'the time of the final judgment' also came to[r]
mind..."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"The time of the final judgment?"[pcms]

"When the world's chaos reaches its limit, and iniquity and immorality are[r]
rampant, many angels and the Lord Himself will descend from heaven to punish all[r]
sinners."[pcms]

*3069|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1623"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"It is said that at that time, so many sinners will be cast into hell that the[r]
dead will overflow from hell and begin to walk the earth... To me, the infected[r]
look just like that."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*3071|
[fc]
Indeed, the infected who wriggle only for their desires without feeling pain or[r]
joy from their wounds do seem like the undead from hell.[pcms]

"I know that it's the work of the virus. That's why, among other reasons, I[r]
can't shake off the fear of them."[pcms]

"Was the outbreak of that virus already a punishment being meted out?"[pcms]

A curse...? Could it be a punishment for the arrogant actions of humans...?[pcms]

*3076|

The moans heard throughout the city bring my spirits down. And it's suffocating.[pcms]

I tried to escape the suffocation by gulping down the water in the cup I was[r]
holding.[pcms]
