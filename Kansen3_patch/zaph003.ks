"Ugyaaaahhhhhhhhh!?! It hurts so muchhhhh!!!! Guahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"[pcms]

*4091|
[fc]
Blood spurts from where Shigeyoshi's right hand fingers used to be, as he lets[r]
out a beast-like roar.[pcms]

*4092|
[fc]
Writhing in agony, Shigeyoshi rolls on the floor, splattering blood everywhere.[pcms]

"Haa... Haa..."[pcms]

*4094|
[fc]
I was captured by Shigeyoshi and brought to this place... a luxury hotel room[r]
near the top floor of the Celesta Tower.[pcms]

*4095|
[fc]
Shigeyoshi's hand had suddenly burst while he was fighting with Wataru and his[r]
men, so they returned to this place for treatment.[pcms]

*4096|
[fc]
Shigeyoshi screams, surrounded by his henchmen. I was sitting a little distance[r]
away, slumped over.[pcms]

"Drugs... Drugs and alcohol! Bring them quickly! Ughhhhhhhhhh!!!"[pcms]

[vo_mob s="mini0001"]

"Please bear with it, Shigeyoshi-san... I'm going to insert the needle..."[pcms]

Gyiiiiii!!! Cut the crap, damn it!"[pcms]

[ns]Woman A[nse]
"Gyah! Ah... gafu..."[pcms]
;//＠銃弾を受け、死亡

*4102|
[fc]
The gun Shigeyoshi was holding spews flames of irrational anger at the girl[r]
treating him. The flames that pierced through the girl's chest easily snatched[r]
away her life.[pcms]

[vo_yuh s="yuho1440"]

"Don't scream!! It echoes, damn it!! Hurry up and do something about this[r]
blood!! Ugh..."[pcms]

[vo_mob s="pank0002"]
[ns]Woman B[nse]
"Please stay still, Shigeyoshi-san! If you thrash too much... the blood..."[pcms]

[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"Ah, ahh... guh... kuhahh... It seems to be taking effect at last... aguh..."[pcms]

*4108|
[fc]
Shigeyoshi, who had been rampaging until now, suddenly calmed down like an[r]
animal hit by a tranquilizer dart on TV.[pcms]

[ns]Henchman A[nse]
"What should we do..."[pcms]

*4110|
[fc]
[ns]Henchman B[nse]
"Ah, ahh... for now, we've got no choice but to let him lie down..."[pcms]

*4111|
[fc]
[ns]Henchman A[nse]
"Right... You, keep an eye on Shigeyoshi-san! If anything happens, call us...[r]
Got it?"[pcms]

*4112|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1441"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"..."[pcms]
;//＠無言で頷く

*4113|
[fc]
Finally falling asleep after continuous groaning, Shigeyoshi and I, who was[r]
ordered to watch over him.[pcms]

*4114|
[fc]
At least I can feel a bit relieved...[pcms]

*4115|
[fc]
I'm not tied up or anything, so I can move freely. But still, alone with the[r]
ferocious Shigeyoshi who is just sleeping. It's unpredictable when he might[r]
start rampaging again.[pcms]

*4116|
[fc]
I'm scared... Wataru... help me...[pcms]

*4117|
[fc]
Even if I wanted to contact Wataru, I didn't bring my cell phone. Is there any[r]
way to communicate...[pcms]

*4118|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1442"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Nothing, huh..."[pcms]

*4119|
[fc]
Looking around the room, there was nothing. Except for Shigeyoshi's blood[r]
scattered on the floor.[pcms]

*4120|
[fc]
If Wataru and the others come chasing after this place, maybe they'll notice[r]
this blood... Maybe it's better if I don't move from here...[pcms]

*4121|
[fc]
Wataru... Wataru... help me, Wataru...[pcms]

*4122|
[fc]
I stared out the window while calling Wataru's name over and over in my heart.[pcms]

*4123|
[fc]
The sky outside the window was brightening. Dawn is coming, and with it, the[r]
United States' gas attack will begin.[pcms]

*4124|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1443"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I wonder if everyone is okay..."[pcms]

"If it's Wataru... I feel like he can do something about this..."[pcms]

*4126|
[fc]
A vague sense of hope.[pcms]

*4127|
[fc]
I believe...[pcms]

*4128|
[fc]
That Wataru will definitely come to save me.[pcms]

*4129|
[fc]
So I won't give up either. If there's any chance...[pcms]

Yeah, he'll surely come to save me. But Shigeyoshi's men have guns... I wonder[r]
if it's safe.[pcms]

But for now, all I can do is believe...[pcms]
