As I said that, Yuuho hugged me without a word and pressed her lips to mine.[pcms]

The kiss with Yuuho that I had dreamed of... I never thought it would come so[r]
easily. But now is not the time to indulge in happiness.[pcms]

I entrusted the camping gear to Yuuho and, gripping only the handle of a mop,[r]
began to move.[pcms]

Following the advice of my senior, I was able to easily enter inside.[pcms]

Moving quickly to the third floor, I killed the sound of my footsteps to avoid[r]
drawing attention.[pcms]

*525|
[fc]
There were quite a few infected wandering around, and even turning down a[r]
corridor required the utmost caution.[pcms]

*526|
[fc]
Honestly, I might be a rabbit who has jumped into a tiger's den. But now that[r]
I've come this far, there's no turning back. When I return, it will be with[r]
Kousuke and Ren, all three of us together.[pcms]

With renewed determination, I tried to proceed when I saw infected swarming at[r]
the entrance of the audio-visual room just down the stairs.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ugh... there are so many already..."[pcms]

Whether they sensed someone inside or knew someone was there, they were trying[r]
to break down the door.[pcms]

*530|
[fc]
The way things were going, it was uncertain how long the door would hold. But it[r]
was absolutely impossible for me alone to fend off that number of infected.[pcms]

*531|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Damn it... what should I do, what can I do"[pcms]

[se buf=0 storage="se038"]

*532|
[fc]
And as I hesitated, the door to the audio-visual room was broken down with a[r]
dull sound, and the infected poured inside.[pcms]

*533|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah... Ren, Kousuke!"[pcms]

*534|
[fc]
The two were quickly surrounded by the rushing infected. I had no choice but to[r]
jump in with a resolve to die if necessary.[pcms]

*535|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Uoooohhh, let go of them!!!"[pcms]

*536|
[fc]
However, now outnumbered, it was hopeless. Unlike my senior who had knowledge of[r]
martial arts, there was nothing an amateur like me could do.[pcms]

*537|
[fc]
In no time at all, I was captured by the swarm of infected and pushed down on[r]
the spot.[pcms]
