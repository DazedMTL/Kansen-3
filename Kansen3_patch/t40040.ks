"No...that's not okay...!!"[pcms]

I turned bright red and frantically waved my hands.[pcms]

*6858|
[fc]
This is bad. It's really bad. Not just bad, but it's so delightful that it's[r]
bad.[pcms]

*6859|
[fc]
Ren is such an honest and good girl, she's kind, she even takes care of chores[r]
around the house without a single complaint, and above all, she's cute. That's[r]
right...sometimes she seems almost doll-like...[pcms]

*6860|
[fc]
Honestly, every time we're told by others that "You two get along too well," I[r]
feel tickled inside, and I was happy.[pcms]

*6861|
[fc]
After all, for me, Ren is not only my "stepsister" but also undoubtedly a "cute[r]
girl."[pcms]

*6862|
[fc]
So when such a Ren says she'll become my bride, it's just...unstoppable. I can't[r]
control myself... I feel like I might cross a line...[pcms]

*6863|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wh-what I mean is, you know, if you say something like that... Given the time[r]
and situation, that..."[pcms]

*6864|
[fc]
Because I denied it so desperately, even Ren's face turned red.[pcms]

"Ah...ahhhhh..."[pcms]

*6871|

Oh no, this isn't just teasing! She really found out!![pcms]

*6872|

I have no words to return or excuses to make, but it can't be helped! That's who[r]
I am, and I'm a boy after all![pcms]

"But, well, if Ren became my bride, it seems like I'd be made to eat nothing but[r]
vegetables..."[pcms]

*6874|

I can't just take this lying down; it would affect my dignity as a brother. I[r]
quietly attempted a counter-punch.[pcms]

Puffing her cheeks adorably, Ren tapped me lightly with the back of her hand[r]
holding the bow.[pcms]

"Hahaha, hey, Ren! Stop it, it hurts..."[pcms]

"If you say that, I might tickle you!?"[pcms]

*6882|

I spread my hands in front of Ren and wiggled my ten fingers ominously.[pcms]

Her arm raised, the bow touched the strings. Soon she swayed her body lightly[r]
and began to play.[pcms]

*6890|
[fc]
I've heard this piece many times before. It's the one Ren always likes to[r]
practice.[pcms]

*6891|

Listening to the light notes, I leaned back into the chair and relaxed.[pcms]

*6892|
[fc]
It's been a while...since I've heard Ren's music...[pcms]

*6893|
[fc]
If...I married Ren, would gentle moments like these continue to flow every[r]
day...?[pcms]

*6894|
[fc]
The sound is really nice... Maybe having Ren as a wife wouldn't be so bad after[r]
all...??[pcms]

I noticed Yuuho's face was as white as paper and drained of blood, and an[r]
