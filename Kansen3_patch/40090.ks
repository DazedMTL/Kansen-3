"...No, no, no, no. That's definitely not okay, that's the one thing I can't[r]
do."[pcms]

*726|
[fc]
Having resisted the dark temptation, I only borrowed the earphones and put the[r]
cellphone back where it originally was.[pcms]

*727|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Uuuuu..."[pcms]

*728|
[fc]
Even though I stopped myself at the last moment... just the thought of snooping[r]
through someone else's cellphone is embarrassing.[pcms]

*729|
[fc]
I wonder if I'm... really such a jealous person to even think of doing that.[pcms]

*730|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*731|
[fc]
I casually glance over at everyone who is asleep.[pcms]

*732|
[fc]
Senpai Maruko and Ren are sleeping...[pcms]

*733|
[fc]
They both complimented me earlier... They said I was cool... They don't know[r]
that I'm such a dark-hearted guy...[pcms]

*734|
[fc]
But... even though I'm such a flawed person, if someone has expectations of me,[r]
I'll try a little harder...[pcms]

*735|
[fc]
Next to them, Yuuho is sleeping with her back turned to me, faintly illuminated[r]
by the lantern.[pcms]

*736|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...I'm sorry, Yuuho."[pcms]

*737|
[fc]
Though it was only an attempt, I can't escape the feeling of guilt. I muttered a[r]
small apology.[pcms]
