As usual, I was diligently practicing for the club[r]
activities, and just as I finished a time attack, I tried to[r]
get out of the pool.[pcms]

*2418|
[fc]
Then, the teacher pointed out that my swimming lacked[r]
spirit, even though it was for timing.[pcms]

[vo_mob s="komon0003"]

"It's not like you. This is the first time I've seen such a[r]
lackadaisical swim, isn't it?"[pcms]

[vo_yuh s="yuho0348"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I'm sorry... I just can't seem to concentrate today."[pcms]

*2421|
[fc]
I understood the teacher's anger all too well. Today, I was[r]
clearly in a listless state.[pcms]

*2422|
[fc]
I didn't hate practice, nor did I hate swimming... but.[pcms]

*2423|
[fc]
Anyway, I just couldn't concentrate, and it felt like[r]
nothing was going right today.[pcms]

[vo_yuh s="yuho0349"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Yeah, um..."[pcms]

*2426|

My response was somewhat distracted. I was just not myself,[r]
completely off my game.[pcms]

[vo_mob s="buinA0011"]
[ns]Club Member A[nse]
"You even came late to practice, which is unusual... Are you[r]
feeling unwell by any chance?"[pcms]

*2428|
[fc]
It's no wonder they would think that, but physically, I was[r]
feeling quite well. The problem was inside my heart...[pcms]

"If that's the case, it's good, but you shouldn't push[r]

[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I know that. Self-management is part of the sport after[r]
all."[pcms]

*2432|
[fc]
If you're an athlete, self-control is inevitable. And yet...[r]
I'm failing at it.[pcms]

*2433|
[fc]
In the end, because of what happened last night with Oshima-[r]
senpai, I was feeling really down.[pcms]

*2434|
[fc]
On top of that, because I went home on my own, I even[r]
received worried emails from Kousuke and Ren-chan.[pcms]

*2435|
[fc]
Wataru went off somewhere too... He probably went looking[r]
for me, I guess.[pcms]

*2436|
[fc]
The summer festival was ruined, and I caused worry and[r]
trouble for everyone, ending with getting scolded at club[r]
activities...[pcms]

*2437|

[vo_mob s="buinB0004"]

"Hey, are you sure you're not feeling sick?"[pcms]

"Eh, ah... no, that's not it."[pcms]

"Yuuho is definitely acting strange today."[pcms]

*2440|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0353"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I'm okay, I'm okay... probably."[pcms]

*2441|
[fc]
From the moment Oshima-senpai called me out, honestly[r]
speaking, I could have predicted that development. Of[r]
course, I hadn't thought it would go as far as a forceful[r]
kiss...[pcms]

*2442|
[fc]
Either way, it was terrible of me to show up there with high[r]
spirits without even deciding whether to accept or reject[r]
him.[pcms]

*2443|
[fc]
[vo_mob s="komon0004"]
[ns]Advisory Teacher[nse]
"Take a little break. Pushing yourself won't do any good."[pcms]

[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Ah, teacher..."[pcms]

*2445|
[fc]
[vo_mob s="komon0005"]
[ns]Advisor Teacher[nse]
"A little rest might change how you feel... Right?"[pcms]

*2446|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0355"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Yes... I understand."[pcms]

*2447|
[fc]
I decided to take a break and then come back, so I took a[r]
rest as the teacher suggested.[pcms]

*2448|
[fc]
I had been feeling awkward and hesitant since last night...[r]
It was my fault for going there with half-hearted feelings.[pcms]

*2449|
[fc]
I should properly apologize to Oshima-senpai and firmly[r]
decline the matter of dating.[pcms]

*2450|
[fc]
It's not good to keep up a half-hearted attitude when I'm[r]
not even interested...[pcms]

*2451|
[fc]
In fact, with that intention in mind, today I made lunch not[r]
as an apology but still... And to make matters worse, I even[r]
ended up biting his lips unintentionally...[pcms]

*2452|
[fc]
I wrote a letter to convey my sincerity, but that alone[r]
seemed insipid. Buying something to bring didn't seem[r]
heartfelt...[pcms]

*2453|
[fc]
My only girlish skill is my cooking ability, honed in a[r]
diner after all.[pcms]

*2454|

[vo_yuh s="yuho0356"]

"Alright, let's go deliver this!"[pcms]

After wiping down my body in the changing room and throwing[r]
on just a jersey, I packed the lunch into my shoulder bag[r]
and headed for the gym where the senior was.[pcms]

*2456|

In the gym where other clubs were practicing. What should I[r]
say when I see the senior?[pcms]

*2457|
[fc]
As I walked thinking about such things...[pcms]

[vo_yuh s="yuho0358"]

A casual remark from her seemed to give me courage.[pcms]

"Kyaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"[pcms]

At that moment, a sudden scream echoed throughout the[r]
school.[pcms]

[vo_yuh s="yuho0359"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"What!?"[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_mob s="buinA0015"]
[ns]Club Member A[nse]
"What's happening?"[pcms]

*2467|
[fc]
It was something so out of the ordinary. It was like the[r]
volume on the TV was turned up too high, theatrical and[r]
lacking any sense of reality...[pcms]

*2468|
[fc]
As I turned my gaze towards the source of the scream, I saw[r]
students running desperately into the entrance as if trying[r]
to escape from something.[pcms]

*2469|
[fc]
Some of them seemed to be injured, their uniforms stained[r]
with crimson.[pcms]

*2470|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0360"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Is this... a drama club practice?"[pcms]

*2471|
[fc]
Straining my eyes to see, I could make out an eerie figure[r]
swaying and walking like a sleepwalker beyond them.[pcms]

*2472|
[fc]
The gymnasium quickly descended into panic, everyone[r]
shuddering at the strange apparition before them.[pcms]

*2473|
[fc]
Inside me, instinct was screaming danger, danger, but I[r]
couldn't figure out what the best course of action was.[pcms]
