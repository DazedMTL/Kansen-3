"So, shall we split up and go our separate ways from here?"[pcms]

*5648|
[fc]
Kousuke suggested it, and we all decided to check out the stores we each wanted[r]
to visit.[pcms]

*5649|
[fc]
Knowing Kousuke, he probably can't wait to head to the music store on the second[r]
floor after "Record Mania".[pcms]

*5650|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Then, I'll also stop by the third floor..."[pcms]

*5651|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai also wanted to see the third floor, so just the two of us got off[r]
at the third floor by the elevator.[pcms]

[fc]
This floor has the long-established sports shop "Takada Sports" and a military[r]
mania store called "Tokyo Ghost".[pcms]

*5653|
[fc]
I visited "Takada Sports" yesterday to borrow a change of shirts and jerseys.[pcms]

*5654|
[fc]
I've also been here a few times to buy sneakers, so I'm pretty familiar with the[r]
place.[pcms]

*5655|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I've never been in this shop before."[pcms]

"...Hmm, quite a selection they have here."[pcms]

*5658|
[fc]
Senpai looked around the store with satisfaction and immediately began peering[r]
into the display cases, apparently eyeing a gun holster.[pcms]

*5659|
[fc]
While this store doesn't carry knives or other bladed weapons, it does have stun[r]
guns, pilot jackets, military canteens, and other items that are fun just to[r]
look at.[pcms]

*5660|
[fc]
I'm not as enthusiastic as senpai, but I look around to see if there's anything[r]
that could be useful for a siege lifestyle.[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wow... an Israeli-made gas mask. They even have stuff like this..."[pcms]

*5662|
[fc]
It's unlikely that we'd need such equipment to prepare for an external attack.[r]
Besides, I wouldn't even know how to use it...[pcms]

"Wataru. Over here."[pcms]

*5664|

Senpai beckoned me over from the next shelf.[pcms]

*5665|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? What is it...?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"Stab-proof clothing. Let's try it on."[pcms]

*5667|
[fc]
Senpai stood facing me with a sturdy-looking vest she had taken off the hanger.[pcms]

*5668|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Um. I just wear it normally, right?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5669|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru_T0014"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"It seems to be made with reinforced plastic fibers, so it's light. This[r]
shouldn't hinder movement."[pcms]

*5670|
[fc]
Senpai started fastening the clasps and buttons on the sides and back of the[r]
vest for me.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru_T0015"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Ah, hold still."[pcms]

*5672|
[fc]
Senpai's slender fingers brushed by my body, barely touching me several times.[pcms]

*5673|
[fc]
It was embarrassingly ticklish, and I couldn't help but fidget.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5674|

"Bear with it. It'll be over soon."[pcms]

*5675|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Y-Yes..."[pcms]

*5676|
[fc]
As senpai leaned in close, I could smell her pleasant scent. It was Maruko-[r]
senpai's smell...[pcms]

*5677|
[fc]
I'm happy to be spending time alone with her like this, getting her attention in[r]
various ways. It reminds me of the intimate atmosphere from last night.[pcms]

*5678|
[fc]
The more time I spend with her, the less I think of senpai's cool demeanor as[r]
distant or unapproachable.[pcms]

*5679|
[fc]
I wonder if I'm getting used to senpai, or if she's starting to change a[r]
little...[pcms]

*5680|
[fc]
Considering how hesitant I was to approach her before because she was so[r]
beautiful, it feels strange now.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru_T0017"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Alright, that should do it..."[pcms]

*5682|
[fc]
Senpai stepped back and scrutinized my whole body closely...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d21"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5683|

[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...Pfft...hahaha... Ahahaha! Sorry, but... this is... Hahahaha!"[pcms]
;//＠悪いと思いながらも爆笑

*5684|
[fc]
When I checked in the mirror next to us, the vest was way too big and baggy on[r]
me, making me look like a child wearing adult clothes.[pcms]

*5685|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Oops. Maybe it's a foreign L size."[pcms]

"Well... There's no need to force yourself into something that doesn't fit your[r]
body. Hahaha..."[pcms]

;//＠まだ笑いをこらえながら

*5687|
[fc]
It's not the first time imported clothes haven't fit me, so it's not much of a[r]
shock. More than that, I'm happy that senpai laughed.[pcms]

*5688|
[fc]
Senpai's smile is rare but radiant, pure, and truly untainted beauty...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d18"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d25"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5690|
[fc]
Senpai blushed slightly and looked away when she noticed my gaze.[pcms]

*5691|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah... sorry, it's nothing."[pcms]

afternoon."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yes! Please do."[pcms]

Senpai nodded at me with a smile and then suddenly tilted her head slightly.[pcms]

anything..."[pcms]

"Maybe he found something else he likes."[pcms]

After leaving the military shop, I decided to check out the second floor as[r]
planned.[pcms]

Senpai seemed to have another place she wanted to visit, so we parted ways at[r]
the elevator.[pcms]

[fc]
This is "Tengu-do Music Store." A long-established shop that's been in business[r]
for 50 years, they not only sell instruments but also offer repairs.[pcms]

*5701|
[fc]
A popular guitarist who once visited Japan had his guitar repaired here, and his[r]
comment on TV before leaving the country, "Tengu-do, I love you!" became a[r]
trendy phrase that year... or so I've heard.[pcms]

*5702|
[fc]
Among the store's regular old customers (including my father), it seems to be a[r]
favored classic joke, but honestly, I don't really get the humor...[pcms]

*5703|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Anyway, maybe it's here..."[pcms]

*5704|

The store has a corner for DJs, with turntables and CDJs. I guessed Kousuke[r]
might be here.[pcms]

*5707|

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Of course. A DJ has the responsibility to make the floor dance with just a[r]
flick of their fingers. It's only natural to be picky."[pcms]

*5708|

As expected, I found Kousuke and Mizuki at the CDJ corner.[pcms]

*5709|

Probably Kousuke insisted on coming here, and Mizuki just went along with it.[pcms]

Before I knew it, they were breaking the glass case lock and trying to carry out[r]

"Well... it's fine."[pcms]

In addition, there's a stage in the hall area where events are sometimes held.[r]
(During the event for the popular game "Idol Breeder," otaku even overflowed[r]
into the 1F hall).[pcms]

*5761|
[fc]
It's a bit more stylish than your typical game center, and it seems it was even[r]
used as a filming location for the silly French action movie "KARASHI".[pcms]

*5762|
[fc]
I'm not that much of a maniac, just a casual gamer who plays fighting games when[r]
I have some free time...[pcms]

*5763|
[fc]
Well, playing a bit seems like it would be a good distraction.[pcms]

*5764|
[fc]
I was thinking that, but...[pcms]

"..."[pcms]

*5766|
[fc]
Seeing the blood splattered on the walls and floor, my mood instantly deflated.[pcms]

*5767|
[fc]
Among these stains is also the blood from those I killed... No matter if they[r]
were infected, it was my first time killing someone. The unpleasant sensation of[r]
crushing bones comes back to me.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's why I hated using a bat..."[pcms]

*5769|
[fc]
Bludgeoning is too direct and primitive a form of violence. You can physically[r]
feel that you've killed someone. If only I had shot them with a gun, it might[r]
have been different.[pcms]

*5770|
[fc]
Jin-san said that sometimes you have to kill to survive, and I understand that,[r]
but... still...[pcms]

*5771|
[fc]
I find myself resenting Jin-san a little.[pcms]

*5772|
[fc]
Or maybe... it's better not to be so detached. Becoming numb to killing people[r]
is wrong... right?[pcms]

*5773|
[fc]
But in this situation, if I'm too soft, I won't survive... It's not just about[r]
me; I have to protect Yuuho and Ren as well...[pcms]

*5774|
[fc]
I remind myself of Tadahiko's words.[pcms]

*5775|
[fc]
Pull yourself together, Wataru... Yes... I need to stay strong...[pcms]

It's not just about looking good; Yuuho was kind of erotic. The bloomers fit[r]

Ren looked like a doll and was adorably cute. It made me want to hug her a[r]
