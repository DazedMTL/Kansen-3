"Well, then..."[pcms]

*638|
[fc]
Having returned to my lookout spot, I composed a brief reply email to Dad.[pcms]

*639|
[fc]
We're doing our best too. Please take care as well, Dad...[pcms]

*640|
[fc]
While pressing the send button, I stretched out my arm trying to find a spot[r]
with better reception.[pcms]

*641|
[fc]
The antenna signal was switching unstably, but I was indeed able to send the[r]
email this time.[pcms]

*642|
[fc]
According to what Maruko-senpai said, it seems we can also access the internet[r]
now. I should try gathering some information too...[pcms]

*643|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...It seems like it's connecting, but it's so slow..."[pcms]

*644|
[fc]
I tried opening a news site for starters, but the access was incredibly[r]
sluggish.[pcms]

*645|
[fc]
Either the line is congested, or it's just unstable...[pcms]

*646|
[fc]
After browsing through various sites as they came to mind, I finally managed to[r]
connect to one of the news sites.[pcms]

*647|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Ah, here it comes."[pcms]

*648|
[fc]
The menu for the latest news was filled with articles related to the "incident"[r]
that's currently happening.[pcms]

*649|
[fc]
"Riots Break Out in the Capital Region" The first piece of news had a nuance[r]
that a group riot had suddenly occurred.[pcms]

*650|
[fc]
"Northeast Infection Disaster Again?" After scrolling through several items, my[r]
own speculation was also announced on the news site.[pcms]

*651|
[fc]
From there on, the news was being updated with the force of a raging torrent.[pcms]

*652|
[fc]
"Infections Emerge in Sapporo, Following New Sendai and Fukuoka" "Chaos[r]
Continues in Major Cities such as Osaka, Nagoya, Hiroshima" "Government[r]
Struggles to Keep Up with Simultaneous Disasters"[pcms]

*653|
[fc]
With each confirmation, I could feel something cold trickling down my back.[pcms]

*654|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...It's really... all over Japan... It's become something terrible..."[pcms]

*655|
[fc]
I wonder what's going to happen to us from now on...[pcms]

*656|
[fc]
I had somehow convinced myself that outside our town, everything was functioning[r]
normally and that someone would come to our rescue...[pcms]

*657|
[fc]
With a disaster of this scale, maybe no one will come to rescue us...?[pcms]

*658|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Huh?"[pcms]

*659|
[fc]
The news hadn't been updated since the afternoon, with no new posts since then.[pcms]

*660|
[fc]
Has the site stopped updating...? Why? Could it be...no way...[pcms]

*661|
[fc]
Shaking off the unpleasant thoughts that threatened to take hold, I tried[r]
browsing other sites.[pcms]

*662|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"What about... other sites..."[pcms]

*663|
[fc]
Emergency evacuation information, guidance to shelters, disaster message boards,[r]
links to government emergency websites...[pcms]

*664|
[fc]
The government links connected surprisingly quickly. But there was hardly any[r]
information that seemed useful. They were just calling for people not to panic[r]
and to wait for accurate information.[pcms]

*665|
[fc]
I also checked the information on shelters. In the city center, several shelters[r]
had an '×' mark on them. It means they're either full or unusable.[pcms]

*666|
[fc]
The ones nearby with a '○' mark are...[pcms]

*667|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Mishuku stationing ground, huh? If we're going overland, this might be the[r]
place."[pcms]

*668|
[fc]
I made a mental note of it and then jumped to the disaster message board.[pcms]

*669|
[fc]
The board was packed with messages.[pcms]

*670|
[fc]
Each message was filled with desperate concern for the safety of family and[r]
acquaintances, or attempts to inform others of their own safety.[pcms]

*671|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I wonder if anyone's seen it..."[pcms]

*672|
[fc]
I tried searching for my own and my friends' names.[pcms]

*673|
[fc]
But the search turned up nothing.[pcms]

*674|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*675|
[fc]
No one is looking for us... We've been left behind here without anyone[r]
knowing...[pcms]

*676|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's not true... Yeah."[pcms]

*677|
[fc]
That's right, I was able to connect with Dad via email. It seems like the[r]
internet has been restored in the past few hours.[pcms]

*678|
[fc]
Real rescue efforts and communication will probably start from now on...[pcms]

*679|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...For that reason, we need to be prepared for when the time comes. We need to[r]
gather more information..."[pcms]

*680|
[fc]
The links to news footage seemed to be broken.[pcms]

*681|
[fc]
Yet, there were diet product ads cheerfully blinking away.[pcms]

*682|
[fc]
Even in such an emergency, they aren't deleted...[pcms]

*683|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Somehow, this kind of thing..."[pcms]

*684|
[fc]
I couldn't help but give a wry smile at the strange sense of deflation.[pcms]

*685|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's right, maybe over there..."[pcms]

*686|
[fc]
I had an idea and immediately tried to access it.[pcms]

*687|
[fc]
The time gauge for the display to appear gradually filled up, and the top page[r]
showed up.[pcms]

*688|
[fc]
"...Thank goodness. I'm glad I became a premium member."[pcms]

*689|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
It's slow, but somehow connected.[pcms]

*690|
[fc]
The latest posts were checked, and there was a massive upload of TV news videos.[r]
Some of them seemed to be self-recorded.[pcms]

*691|
[fc]
"Let's see... this one first, I guess."[pcms]

*692|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
I selected DHK News for now. The loading was unusually slow.[pcms]

*693|
[fc]
"This is going to take quite some time..."[pcms]

*694|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
I was about to put down my phone when I suddenly noticed Yuuho's cell phone next[r]
to me.[pcms]

*695|
[fc]
"Ah..."[pcms]

*696|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
Yuuho's cell phone had earphones connected to it.[pcms]

*697|
[fc]
"Right. It does make sound, after all."[pcms]

*698|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
It would be bad to startle everyone. Before playing the news, I should connect[r]
the earphones.[pcms]

*699|
[fc]
But... my earphones are in my bag. If I go to get them and rustle around, Ren[r]
might wake up...[pcms]

*700|
[fc]
"I'll just borrow these for a bit."[pcms]

*701|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
Deciding to borrow Yuuho's earphones, I picked up the cell phone.[pcms]

*702|
[fc]
"..."[pcms]

*703|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
Suddenly, I thought of Oshima-senpai and Yuuho again.[pcms]

*704|
[fc]
What kind of relationship does Yuuho have... with Senpai?[pcms]

*705|
[fc]
Is she dating Oshima-senpai... or maybe, actually, she has someone else she's[r]
dating...?[pcms]

*706|
[fc]
"...Should I... take a peek inside...?"[pcms]

*707|
