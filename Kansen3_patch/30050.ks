As I was about to head to the third floor, I thought I heard[r]
a familiar voice and turned towards it.[pcms]

It was the sight of Senior Margarita kicking down the[r]
swarming infected one after another.[pcms]

*116|
[fc]
Even at a time like this, her kicks are so beautiful that[r]
even a complete amateur like me can tell...[pcms]

She quickly knocked down another one attacking from behind[r]
and, as if she had finished a job, she dusted off her hands[r]
with a pat-pat.[pcms]

"Not even worth mentioning."[pcms]

*122|

Senior Margarita looked down at the infected with cold eyes.[pcms]

*123|
[fc]
As I was captivated by her chilling gaze, she glared at my[r]
face.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"..."[pcms]

*125|
[fc]
While staring at me, Senior Margarita quietly took her[r]
stance.[pcms]

*126|
[fc]
Eh?[pcms]

*127|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wait, wait, wait! Please wait, Senior!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a7"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*128|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0055"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Begging for your life?"[pcms]

*129|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"No, that's not it. I'm different from those guys! I'm not[r]
infected."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_mar s="maru0056"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Infected?"[pcms]

*131|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"They're probably infected! With 'UNKNOWN-LV4'!!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a10"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Margarita[nse]
"The Tohoku infection disaster? Impossible. But indeed, you[r]
seem different from them. Escape quickly before the school[r]
is completely overrun by them."[pcms]

"I can't escape!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*134|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0058"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Why? You value your life, don't you?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*135|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I have a sister. She's in the music room upstairs. And my[r]
best friend is in another place... I can't just abandon them[r]
and run away."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*136|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0059"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Their movements are slow. If you're determined, escaping[r]
should be no problem."[pcms]

*137|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Maybe for my best friend. But my sister... Ren has always[r]
been physically weak. She's slow and doesn't have much[r]
stamina. I have to protect her. She's family."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*138|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0060"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*139|
[fc]
Senior Margarita looked at me with an indescribable emotion[r]
on her face, different from her usual expressionless one.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*140|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0061"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Family, huh... Then do as you wish."[pcms]

*141|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senior... Could you please help me? It's embarrassing to[r]
say, but I can only manage to run away on my own... It would[r]
be reassuring if you could come with us..."[pcms]

*142|
[fc]
I hastily called out to Senior Margarita as she tried to[r]
slip past me while readjusting the backpack filled with her[r]
belongings.[pcms]

*143|
[fc]
I think it's pathetic of me.[pcms]

*144|
[fc]
But as I said, I can only manage to run away on my own.[pcms]

*145|
[fc]
I'm not confident that I can escape with Ren.[pcms]

*146|
[fc]
No, I'm quite certain that we won't be able to make it...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*147|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0062"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*148|
[fc]
Senior Margarita's face, staring straight at me, showed no[r]
expression at all, as if the emotion she had shown earlier[r]
was just an illusion.[pcms]

*149|
[fc]
She just looked at me coldly.[pcms]

*150|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...I'm sorry. I relied on you too much, Senior. I'll manage[r]
to rescue my sister by myself."[pcms]

*151|
[fc]
Just as I bowed my head and was about to head to the third[r]
floor, Senior Margarita overtook me and ran up the stairs.[pcms]

*152|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senior!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a7"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*153|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0063"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"It can't be helped. Even a brief encounter is a connection[r]
from a past life. But if you dawdle, I'll leave you behind."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*154|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yes! Thank you very much."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*155|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0064"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Save your thanks until we're out of here. If your sister[r]
has become one of them, I won't show any mercy."[pcms]

*156|
[fc]
With a quiet intensity, Senior Margarita declared that and I[r]
followed her resolutely.[pcms]

*157|
[fc]
That's right. Ren might already have fallen prey to them.[pcms]

*158|
[fc]
Even so...[pcms]

;//BG：黒画面
[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=1000][hide_chara_int]

*159|
[fc]
I prayed for Ren's safety as I chased after Senior Margarita[r]
up the stairs.[pcms]
