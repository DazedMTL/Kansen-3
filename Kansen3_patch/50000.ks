We arrived at the hideout Hiko-chin mentioned... the backyard of the izakaya[r]
"Dedepou".[pcms]

*3|
[fc]
The hatch leading underground was between the electrical panel and a large[r]
refrigerator. Beer cases were stacked tightly around, and shelves were lined[r]
with stocks of Japanese sake and Western liquor.[pcms]

*4|
[fc]
It seemed someone had turned on the lights, and as we blinked in the sudden[r]
brightness... we silently stared at what was in my hands.[pcms]

*5|
[fc]
The gun entrusted to me by Hiko-chin...[pcms]

*6|
[fc]
I spoke briefly, telling everyone that Hiko-chin had returned to Yotsubase.[pcms]

*7|
[fc]
For a moment, everyone was at a loss for words...[pcms]

Ren clung to my arm, sobbing.[pcms]

"Hiko-chin...!"[pcms]

Yuuho bit her lip tightly, trying to hold back her tears.[pcms]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"...Damn it, Hiko-chin always has to act so cool...!"[pcms]

*13|
[fc]
Kousuke said gruffly, his eyes also shimmering with something.[pcms]

*14|
[fc]
I understand Hiko-chin's logic and feelings. But thinking about Hiko-chin's[r]
fate... tears start to well up in my eyes too.[pcms]

*16|
[fc]
Without a word, Maruko-senpai placed her hand on my shoulder.[pcms]

*17|
[fc]
Her gaze was stern and strong... as if encouraging me to stay firm and keep[r]
going.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"Let's go..."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*20|
[fc]
As I started to walk, I hesitated at the unfamiliar sensation of the gun I was[r]
carrying.[pcms]

*21|
[fc]
The gun gleamed dully.[pcms]

*22|
[fc]
Upon closer inspection, there was something like a hook attached to it.[pcms]

*23|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I guess it's supposed to be used like this..."[pcms]

*24|
[fc]
I hooked the gun onto my pants and pushed it into the gap in my clothes.[pcms]

*25|
[fc]
Then, I followed after everyone else.[pcms]

The backyard led to the kitchen, which connected to the interior of "Dedepou".[pcms]

The shutter was slightly open, letting in light from outside.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*28|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"The shutter isn't locked? Did someone try to leave, or did they come early to[r]
prepare?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*29|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1280"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"But, I don't feel anyone's presence."[pcms]

*30|
[fc]
We cautiously moved through the deserted interior of the store.[pcms]

*31|
[fc]
As we approached the door, sounds from outside began to reach us.[pcms]

*32|
[fc]
The music from the public address system and the calls of the shops... as if[r]
nothing had happened in the world outside, and the usual streets of Shibuya were[r]
right there...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren1303"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"This feels... strange."[pcms]

*34|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah..."[pcms]

*35|
[fc]
But what was decisively different was the absence of people's presence.[pcms]

*36|
[fc]
No voices of people. No sound of cars. There was no sense of bustle at all.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"...Hey, let's go outside and see!"[pcms]

*38|
[fc]
Yuuho looked around at everyone as if she had made up her mind.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j7"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*39|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren1304"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Is it, is it safe...?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*40|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1281"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Indeed there are concerns, but we want to know what's happening in town. If we[r]
sense any danger, we'll make sure to be careful so we can return at any time."[pcms]

*41|
[fc]
We nodded in agreement and cautiously made our way to the door... and pushed up[r]
the half-open shutter...[pcms]
