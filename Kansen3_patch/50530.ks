"It might sound cheap, but maybe it's about being true to[r]
oneself..."[pcms]

*3131|
[fc]
"But that assumes you know what 'yourself' is. I can't say[r]
for certain that I understand myself that well."[pcms]

*3132|
[fc]
Jin is armed with a gun. But he doesn't go on a rampage with[r]
it, and he's quite cooperative.[pcms]

*3133|
[fc]
"So maybe it's because he himself wants to be that way. If[r]
that's the case, maybe he's fundamentally a good person..."[pcms]

"Salvation... redemption, huh. Even so, I can't agree with[r]
it."[pcms]

*3135|
[fc]
With a face like she had tasted something bitter, the senior[r]
muttered.[pcms]

*3136|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...I feel the same way."[pcms]

[fc]
I find Jin's words interesting, but still, they seem too[r]
extreme... or like wordplay, and they don't seem to fit with[r]
what we're feeling right now.[pcms]

*3138|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm not religious, so I don't really understand things like[r]
eschatology... but I still can't accept what's happening[r]
right now."[pcms]

*3139|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Why does it have to start here in Tokyo... in Shibuya? The[r]
students at school, our families... Sure, not everything was[r]
perfect, but..."[pcms]

*3140|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"No matter how much they talk about divine punishment or the[r]
work of God, it doesn't justify us suffering like this...[r]
There must be others who should be atoning..."[pcms]

*3141|
[fc]
"That's right... Our friends at school, the masters... It's[r]
strange that such good people would be the first to be[r]
punished!"[pcms]

*3142|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"If I... if we survive this, we'll find those people... the[r]
ones who should be atoning, and make sure something like[r]
this never happens again!"[pcms]

*3143|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"If we don't, mom... yes, the people who were sacrificed[r]
before, those who didn't make it this time... those who got[r]
infected and are wandering outside, they won't be able to[r]
rest in peace..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3144|
[fc]
After speaking so passionately, I noticed Maruko-senpai[r]
looking at me with a bit of surprise.[pcms]

*3145|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, sorry. It's not like getting angry at you will solve[r]
anything, senpai..."[pcms]

*3146|
[fc]
I meant to keep it under control, but I ended up speaking so[r]
forcefully... It's embarrassing to talk so much about my own[r]
thoughts...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3147|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1628"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"No, don't worry about it."[pcms]

*3148|
[fc]
Senpai gave me a comforting smile that seemed almost like a[r]
chuckle.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3149|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1629"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Rather, I should be the one thanking you... Thank you. Your[r]
words have helped me organize my thoughts a bit."[pcms]

*3150|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1630"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"First, let's survive. Whether the cause is a human disaster[r]
or the will of the Lord, we can think about that later."[pcms]

*3151|
[fc]
After a brief pause, senpai suddenly became serious and[r]
looked at me.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3152|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1631"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...Right. Have you confessed to Kannagi yet?"[pcms]

*3153|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wha..."[pcms]

*3154|
[fc]
What's with this sudden question?! And why does senpai even[r]
know about my feelings!?[pcms]

*3155|
[fc]
Between Tadahiko and senpai... could it be... that everyone[r]
knows by now...?[pcms]

*3156|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"No, not yet..."[pcms]

*3157|
[fc]
I managed to maintain a semblance of calm on the surface as[r]
I mumbled my reply.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3158|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1632"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"I see, not yet..."[pcms]

*3159|
[fc]
What do you mean 'I see'? That 'I see'... Can you see right[r]
through me, to the fact that I'm too chicken to confess!?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3160|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1633"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"You are a strange one, aren't you?"[pcms]

*3161|
[fc]
Whether she's noticed my inner turmoil or not, senpai shapes[r]
her lips into a light smile and continues.[pcms]

*3162|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1634"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"You act with such determination, as if your life depends on[r]
it, and you speak with so much passion that it seems your[r]
emotions might overflow. Yet, there's something unreliable[r]
about you..."[pcms]

*3163|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1635"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"It's quite intriguing."[pcms]
;//＠半笑いで

*3164|
[fc]
It's complicated... Is that... a compliment?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3165|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1636"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"We don't know what will happen next, and now might be...[r]
yes, I think if you confess now, it won't turn out badly."[pcms]

*3166|
[fc]
I choke up again...[pcms]

*3167|
[fc]
Considering what happened in the kitchen earlier, I might[r]
even start to hope... maybe...[pcms]

*3168|
[fc]
But it's strange how senpai seems to have read the situation[r]
so thoroughly. I even start to wonder if she has[r]
clairvoyance...[pcms]

*3169|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well... but, you know... the suspension bridge effect, was[r]
it? Confessing in a situation like this, well... It feels a[r]
bit like cheating..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f21"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3170|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1637"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Wataru, you're so earnest."[pcms]
;//＠笑いを含んでいる

*3171|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai laughed a little louder this time.[pcms]

*3172|
[fc]
Ah... so senpai can laugh like this. It feels like this is[r]
the first time I've seen such a happy smile from her.[pcms]

*3173|
[fc]
Her laughing face looks just like any other girl's, and even[r]
though it's not that kind of situation, my heart strangely[r]
starts to race.[pcms]

[fc]
If she's this beautiful, she must have a boyfriend, right?[r]
She probably shows that boyfriend the same smile she showed[r]
me just now...[pcms]

*3175|
[fc]
But... I wonder what kind of person he is. It's bothering[r]
me...[pcms]

*3176|
[fc]
Normally, I wouldn't have the courage to ask such a thing,[r]
but with senpai as she is now, I feel like she might[r]
answer...[pcms]

*3177|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"What about you, senpai... Do you have a boyfriend?"[pcms]

*3178|
[fc]
The moment I asked, "No, I don't have one..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f25"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3179|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1638"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
After a brief pause, Senior Maruko awkwardly spoke.[pcms]

*3180|
[fc]
"No, well... I had one when I was a child, but for the past[r]
few years, various things happened and I just haven't met[r]
anyone..."[pcms]

*3181|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1639"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"The people I get along with are all older and married...[r]
Even if they're around my age, they're more like comrades...[r]
like battle buddies..."[pcms]

*3182|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1640"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
It was an unusually roundabout and flustered response from[r]
the senior.[pcms]

*3183|
[fc]
Senior sure is quick to poke at me, but when it comes to her[r]
own love life, she's not so smooth...[pcms]

*3184|
[fc]
It would be too cruel to tease her too much, so let's change[r]
the subject.[pcms]

*3185|
[fc]
"Then, what's your type? What kind of person do you like?"[pcms]

*3186|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"My type...? Well... I like a man who is kind and brave."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3187|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1641"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
When I changed the topic, Senior Maruko quickly recovered.[pcms]

*3188|
[fc]
"Someone who can do martial arts or something?"[pcms]

*3189|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's part of it."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3190|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1642"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"But even if he's not physically strong, someone who can[r]
show courage when it counts, someone reliable in a pinch is[r]
what I prefer."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3191|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1643"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Reliability, huh..."[pcms]

*3192|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
What kind of person could Senior Maruko, who is so capable[r]
herself, rely on...? At least someone more adult or stronger[r]
than her, otherwise what's the point of relying on them...?[pcms]

*3193|
[fc]
I wonder what kind of superman that would be.[pcms]

*3194|
[fc]
"It's obvious for the strong to step forward, but I like a[r]
man who doesn't hesitate to step up even if he's weak..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3195|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1644"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"That's different from foolhardiness. It means being someone[r]
who can think of ways to win despite their weaknesses and[r]
take action."[pcms]

*3196|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1645"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...That's why I like brave men. And of course, it goes[r]
without saying that they should cherish their friends and[r]
family..."[pcms]

*3197|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1646"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
Senior cut off her words mid-sentence and looked intently at[r]
my face as if she had just thought of something.[pcms]

*3198|
[fc]
"...In that regard, I might give you a passing grade?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3199|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1647"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Eh... Yes?!"[pcms]

*3200|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
Her sudden remark made my heart skip a beat.[pcms]

*3201|
[fc]
What... was that just now? It felt a bit like a[r]
confession... No, there's no deep meaning behind it... haha.[pcms]

*3202|
[fc]
Since I fell silent, Senior seemed to blush out of reflex as[r]
well.[pcms]

*3203|
[fc]
"It's just a hypothetical! Don't take it seriously. ...First[r]
of all, I dislike unfaithful men."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f14"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3204|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1648"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Of course, that makes sense... haha..."[pcms]

*3205|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
Senior slowly stood up from her seat.[pcms]

*3206|
[fc]
"I'm also supporting you from the shadows. Do your best.[r]
Take good care of Kannagi."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f21"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3207|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1649"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Thank you very much, senior..."[pcms]

*3208|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well then, I'm going to rest soon. There's still more to do[r]
tomorrow."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f17"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3209|

[vo_mar s="maru1650"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Then, I'll go to bed too. Good night."[pcms]

*3210|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
We decided to each return to our own beds.[pcms]

*3211|
[fc]
Hmm... If we keep talking like this, I might end up saying[r]
too much...[pcms]
