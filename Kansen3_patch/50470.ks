"Wow, there's quite a lot here."[pcms]

*2450|
[fc]
Not only the dishes and cooking utensils used for dinner, but also the lunch[r]
boxes and water bottles eaten in the basement were piled up in the sink.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Okay."[pcms]

While enjoying the luxury of using plenty of water, we started washing up.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2454|

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"...But man, thank goodness, Dad."[pcms]

*2455|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah... When I saw the email about being attacked by crows, I thought about the[r]
worst-case scenario..."[pcms]

*2456|
[fc]
We haven't been able to contact him directly, but it was a relief to confirm he[r]
was safe. Ren will be able to sleep peacefully tonight too.[pcms]

*2457|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I hope Kousuke and Yuuho's parents are safe too."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2458|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Hmm..."[pcms]

*2459|
[fc]
Without turning his face to me, Kousuke groaned.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2460|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"My family... probably no good. No contact for this long probably means... well,[r]
considering the situation, I think they're dead."[pcms]

*2461|
[fc]
I couldn't find any words to respond to Kousuke's matter-of-fact statement.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2462|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Don't look like that. I was prepared for it. ...I still can't really feel it,[r]
like it hasn't hit me yet, so I don't feel sad or anything."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2463|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Just... a bit of regret, you know? That morning was the last time we ate[r]
together."[pcms]

*2464|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"I was in a hurry because of basketball practice in the morning and left in a[r]
rush. I wish I had talked a little more... stuff like that..."[pcms]

*2465|
[fc]
While skillfully spinning the plates and rinsing off the foam, Kousuke muttered.[pcms]

*2466|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...But you did talk a little, right?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2467|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Well yeah. Dad was his usual self, nagging about everything. Telling me to[r]
study instead of just doing music and sports while grumbling and reading the[r]
newspaper..."[pcms]

*2468|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Mom was carefree as always. Saying things like 'do your best in the game'...[r]
Oh, right..."[pcms]

*2469|
[fc]
Staring at his own lunch box that he was washing, Kousuke muttered softly.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2470|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"I forgot to thank Mom for the lunch..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2471|
[fc]
After that, we fell silent for a while, just moving our hands in silence.[pcms]

*2472|
[fc]
The longer we stayed silent, the harder it became to break it. The sound of[r]
water hitting the dishes eased the awkwardness of the silence.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2473|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"...By the way, what did Hiko say last?"[pcms]

*2474|
[fc]
The one who broke the silence was Kousuke, who couldn't stand being quiet.[pcms]

*2475|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"'Get psyched up'..."[pcms]

*2476|
[fc]
As I answered, I thought about how Hiko had always been encouraging.[pcms]

*2477|
[fc]
Unlike Maruko-senpai and Kousuke who are always so sharp, he must have been[r]
worried about me... That's why he gave me a gun too.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2478|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"That's so like Hiko."[pcms]

*2479|
[fc]
It feels like it's been a long time since we parted with Hiko around noon today,[r]
even though it wasn't that long ago.[pcms]

*2480|
[fc]
We haven't heard from him in a while, so maybe... Hiko is already...[pcms]

*2481|
[fc]
No... that can't be... He must be with Inori-san by now...[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah... I think so."[pcms]

*2487|
[fc]
Feeling that Kousuke felt the same way, we once again fell into a lonely[r]
silence.[pcms]

Hiko... Master... Mama... everyone at school... For every survivor, someone is[r]
lost... How many times will we have to experience this loneliness?[pcms]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"But still, it's great that Mizuki is safe."[pcms]

*2490|
[fc]
With a brighter tone as if trying to cheer up, Kousuke started talking again.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Until now, even though she was somewhere in Shibuya just like us, we hardly[r]
ever met..."[pcms]

*2492|
[fc]
Mizuki disappeared once before, and Kousuke searched desperately for her. But he[r]
couldn't find her at all.[pcms]

*2493|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah. We didn't notice she was going in and out of the nearby building."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"And now we've met again like this. Just earlier, we ate together again like old[r]
times... It feels really strange."[pcms]

*2495|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"At first, I was worried because she looked and felt so different. But watching[r]
her talk with Yuuho and Ren-chan made me realize she hasn't changed at all[r]
inside. I was happy about that."[pcms]

Nodding along with me, Kousuke suddenly put on a serious face.[pcms]

Kousuke and Mizuki used to date, after all...[pcms]

I don't know what Mizuki is thinking now, but at least Kousuke still has[r]
feelings for her.[pcms]

*2501|

Whatever the answer may be, I thought it would definitely be good for them to[r]
have a proper talk.[pcms]

*2504|
[fc]
Kousuke scratched the tip of his nose with an embarrassed look. A bubble of soap[r]
stuck right in the middle of his smile.[pcms]

Damn it! The impression of the tank top and side boob and underboob I saw in the[r]
evening was too strong, and I accidentally let something slip![pcms]

Yeah, Kousuke and Mizuki used to date, after all...[pcms]

I don't know what Mizuki thinks, but at least Kousuke still has feelings for[r]
her... Rather, his possessiveness is totally on full display.[pcms]

*2514|
[fc]
Even now, he's glaring at me seriously.[pcms]

*2515|
[fc]
Mizuki said it too, but it's not like they get smaller just by looking...[pcms]

*2516|
[fc]
After all, it's not like I saw them without clothes on. I wasn't looking with a[r]
lecherous gaze like Shigeyoshi, licking his lips or anything (I hope).[pcms]

*2517|
[fc]
...Come to think of it, what about Kousuke...?[pcms]

*2518|
[fc]
I wonder if he's ever seen Mizuki's breasts. You know, that... sex thing...?[r]
Does he have that kind of experience?[pcms]

*2519|
[fc]
If he did that kind of thing with those breasts... ...Honestly, I'd be super[r]
jealous.[pcms]

*2520|

But Kousuke is surprisingly innocent... Maybe they haven't... yet...??[pcms]

Mizuki's tits?"[pcms]

"...I sincerely apologize."[pcms]

Mumbling an apology and then thinking for a while, I gently started talking.[pcms]

"You should have a good talk with Mizuki next time. I'm sure... you'll be able[r]
