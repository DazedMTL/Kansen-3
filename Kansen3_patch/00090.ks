*1887|
[fc]
The sun was still high in the sky, not even a hint of[r]
evening yet, but while I was tucked into my futon, the hands[r]
of the clock mercilessly moved forward, pointing towards 6[r]
PM.[pcms]

*1888|
[fc]
Thinking about Yuuho and Oshima-senpai weighed heavily on my[r]
mind, but considering the promised meeting time, I had to[r]
start getting ready to go out soon.[pcms]

*1889|
[fc]
But my mood had sunk to rock bottom, and I just couldn't[r]
bring myself to start preparing to go out.[pcms]

*1890|
[fc]
Yuuho and Oshima-senpai... No, not just Oshima-senpai.[pcms]

*1891|
[fc]
Caught up in the festive mood of the summer festival,[r]
someone else might also confess their feelings. It's[r]
possible![pcms]

*1892|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Uwaaaaaah, the thought of Yuuho dating someone other than[r]
me, being confessed to by someone else..."[pcms]

*1893|
[fc]
As I rolled around on the bed with those thoughts, an idea[r]
suddenly struck me.[pcms]

*1894|
[fc]
If someone other than Oshima-senpai were to confess, why[r]
couldn't that "someone else" be me?[pcms]

*1895|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's right. Even if I confess... Yeah. Yuuho, I've always[r]
liked you. 'Well Wataru, I also...' No, that's not going to[r]
happen."[pcms]

*1896|
[fc]
Me, with no particular talents, unlike Yuuho or Kousuke or[r]
Ren, and without a clear dream for the future to pursue.[pcms]

*1897|
[fc]
Do I even have the right to confess?[pcms]

*1898|
[fc]
No, more importantly than that, if I confess and get[r]
rejected, our current relationship might crumble and I might[r]
not be able to be with Yuuho anymore.[pcms]

*1899|
[fc]
That was what I feared the most.[pcms]

*1900|
[fc]
To go to the festival or not to go...[pcms]

*1901|
[fc]
No, the real question is whether to confess to Yuuho or not.[r]
That's the biggest issue.[pcms]

*1902|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"What should I do? What should I do? Me?"[pcms]

*1903|
[fc]
Muttering to myself won't start anything or solve anything.[pcms]

*1904|
[fc]
But still...[pcms]

*1905|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Haa..."[pcms]

*1906|
[fc]
Just as I let out a sigh involuntarily, I heard a knock from[r]
behind me.[pcms]

*1907|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0075" v=70]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Big brother. It's about time, isn't it?"[pcms]
;//＠オフ。ドアの向こう

*1908|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren...?"[pcms]

*1909|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0076" v=70]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Not 'Ren...?' You're not going to the festival? We're going[r]
to be late."[pcms]
;//＠オフ。ドアの向こう

*1910|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"You can go by yourself already, can't you?"[pcms]

*1911|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0077" v=70]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Big brother, aren't you going to the festival?"[pcms]
;//＠オフ。ドアの向こう

*1912|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"It's not like... I'm saying I won't go."[pcms]

*1913|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0078" v=70]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Is it because I yelled earlier?"[pcms]
;//＠オフ。ドアの向こう

*1914|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh?"[pcms]

*1915|
[fc]
Surprised by Ren's suddenly clouded voice from beyond the[r]
door, I sat up on the bed.[pcms]

*1916|
[fc]
Ren yelled...?[pcms]

*1917|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0079" v=70]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I'm sorry, big brother. That wasn't because I was angry,[r]
but because I was surprised... If that made you feel like[r]
not going to the festival, then..."[pcms]
;//＠オフ。ドアの向こう

*1918|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, eh? No. That was my fault. And I really didn't notice[r]
you at all, I had no intention of peeking. But... sorry!"[pcms]

*1919|
[fc]
Thinking about it, Ren's voice that I heard through the door[r]
did sound a bit angry at first.[pcms]

*1920|
[fc]
But after hearing my non-committal answer, she seemed to[r]
misunderstand that she was the reason I didn't want to go.[pcms]

*1921|
[fc]
In a hurry to apologize, I heard a thud against the door[r]
like a forehead bumping into it, followed by Ren's lonely[r]
voice.[pcms]

*1922|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0080" v=70]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I can't go to the festival alone..."[pcms]
;//＠オフ。ドアの向こう

*1923|
[fc]
Moved by her sad voice, my heart wavered.[pcms]

*1924|
[fc]
Inherently sensitive to sunlight and crowds, Ren couldn't go[r]
out much anymore. Now that she couldn't go to Akita, her[r]
only summer enjoyment was this festival.[pcms]

*1925|
[fc]
She's no longer the little girl who used to follow behind[r]
me. Even though Yuuho and others will be at the venue and[r]
she should be able to go alone by now...[pcms]

*1926|
[fc]
Still, the image of Ren following behind me resurfaced in my[r]
mind.[pcms]

*1927|
[fc]
Is this also a kind of instinct as a brother...?[pcms]

*1928|
[fc]
With a wry smile on my face, I got up from the bed and[r]
opened the door.[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0081"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Big brother..."[pcms]

*1930|
[fc]
The moment I opened the door, Ren's face came into view.[pcms]

*1931|
[fc]
And then there was Ren's yukata that she had changed into[r]
earlier.[pcms]

*1932|
[fc]
That was shocking in its own way, but now her loveliness[r]
made my heart flutter. As her brother, how could I let such[r]
a cute sister go alone?[pcms]

*1933|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Looks like Ren is all set."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1934|
[fc]
Petting Ren's head with a pat as one would do with a child[r]
made her face light up with joy instantly.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1935|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'll get ready, so just wait a bit."[pcms]

*1936|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0082"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Okay, big brother♪"[pcms]

*1937|
[fc]
Seeing Ren's face light up with a smile made me feel like[r]
the things I was worrying about weren't such a big deal[r]
after all.[pcms]

*1938|
[fc]
When Ren and I arrived at the festival venue, Kousuke and[r]
Yuuho were already waiting for us at the meeting spot.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_m6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=143 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1939|

[vo_yuh s="yuho0077"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Ah! Wataru, Ren-chan, over here, over here!!"[pcms]

*1940|
[fc]
The moment she spotted me, Yuuho waved her hand and called[r]
out to us with a loud voice.[pcms]

*1941|
[fc]
Yuuho always has a healthy cuteness about her, but in a[r]
yukata, she somehow looks more mature and even cuter.[pcms]

*1942|
[fc]
While my heart raced at the sight of Yuuho in a different[r]
look, I couldn't help but think of Oshima-senpai and their[r]
relationship.[pcms]

*1943|
[fc]
I wonder if Yuuho has been in touch with him since then?[pcms]

*1944|
[fc]
Maybe Oshima-senpai really did ask for Yuuho's contact[r]
information with the intention of confessing his feelings[r]
today?[pcms]

*1945|
[fc]
No--[pcms]

*1946|
[fc]
Perhaps he's already confessed.[pcms]

*1947|
[fc]
And maybe Yuuho has accepted...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_b7"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1948|
[fc]

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Yuuho-chan, Ko-chan."[pcms]

[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"No, it's fine. I came early. We're right on time, right?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_a3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1950|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Ren-chan, you look cute in that yukata."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1951|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0084"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Thank you, Ko-chan. Yuuho-chan's yukata is cute too."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_m6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=143 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1952|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0079"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I said it wasn't my style, but they told me to wear it[r]
anyway."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_a3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1953|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"In Yuuho's case, it's like the clothes make the monk..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_m6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=143 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1954|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0080"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Kousuke, you just pronounced it as 'monk', didn't you? It's[r]
supposed to be 'even a packhorse driver can look attractive[r]
in the right outfit'. It's not 'monk', because it refers to[r]
someone who carries loads, not a grandchild."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_a6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1955|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"You're noisy."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1956|
[fc]
While the three of them exchanged banter like a comedy act,[r]
I listened with a smile on my face but was carefully[r]
observing Yuuho's behavior.[pcms]

*1957|
[fc]
Could it be that Yuuho is so cheerful because she has[r]
already been confessed to by Oshima-senpai and accepted?[pcms]

*1958|
[fc]
No, or maybe she's excitedly waiting for a confession that's[r]
supposed to happen later...?[pcms]

*1959|
[fc]
My heart grew heavier and darker, and I couldn't even keep[r]
up a smile anymore when I felt someone pull my hand,[r]
prompting me to look up.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_m5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=143 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"What's wrong? Wataru. Aren't we going?"[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_m4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=143 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0082"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"No way. We just decided to go around the food stalls for[r]
now. Look, Kousuke is already heading there, right?"[pcms]

*1963|
[fc]
As Yuuho said this and I looked over, Ren was glancing back[r]
at me while being led ahead by Kousuke.[pcms]

*1964|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, yeah. I was just spacing out and didn't hear. Sorry."[pcms]

"Come on, let's go."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

Led by the cheerful Yuuho, I started walking towards the[r]
food stalls.[pcms]

"Here you go, two takoyakis with extra spicy sauce. That'll[r]

;//＠忠彦

*1968|
[fc]
Suddenly, I heard a familiar voice coming from one of the[r]
stalls.[pcms]

*1969|
[fc]
Drawn by the voice, I saw Tadahiko cooking takoyaki under a[r]
noren curtain that read "Kyoto-style Takoyaki."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"Tadahiko is doing takoyaki again this year."[pcms]

"Hey, everyone's here."[pcms]

*1972|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0084"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Tadahiko's takoyaki is Kyoto-style this year? How is it[r]
different from Osaka- style?"[pcms]

*1973|
[fc]
[ns]Tadahiko[nse]
"Kyoto-style is crispy on the outside and gooey on the[r]

*1975|

[ns]Tadahiko[nse]
"You always say the nicest things, Ren. Here's a special[r]
service for you."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1976|
[fc]
Special service or not, Tadahiko treating us to takoyaki has[r]
become an annual tradition.[pcms]

this rate."[pcms]

[ns]Tadahiko[nse]
"As long as I'm making something that people pay for, I'm a[r]

you guys."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1984|
[fc]
Joking around with Tadahiko, we savored his takoyaki.[pcms]

*1985|
[fc]
This is the first year for Kyoto-style, but he's been making[r]
it every year and his skills are definitely improving.[pcms]

*1986|
[fc]
But... somehow, whether it's delicious or whatever else[r]
about the takoyaki doesn't matter as much as Yuuho does to[r]
me right now; I'm the only one who can't quite taste it.[pcms]

*1987|
[fc]
The usual takoyaki that's fluffy both inside and out is[r]
good, but this one with a crispy outside and fluffy inside[r]
is also nice, I thought.[pcms]

"Matinia," located in South America, is a country where a[r]

conflict with anti-government organizations for many years.[pcms]

*2022|

The news that the anti-government side finally overthrew the[r]
military dictatorship and established a new government after[r]
countless civil wars is still fresh in the memory of even us[r]

*2023|

If senpai's father is an ambassador--[pcms]

*2024|

Then naturally he was on the anti-government side at that[r]
time... It's possible that even as a child she had to learn[r]
to protect herself to survive.[pcms]

While what she said was perfectly reasonable, Yuuho, Ren,[r]

Senpai said this firmly and then resumed her perfect[r]

*2035|

Although it wasn't a rapid-fire gun by any means, she[r]
quickly reloaded and shot down as many prizes as there were[r]

The fact that her targets were strange fancy characters was[r]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*2047|

However, her stancestepping on the shooting range and[r]

In fact, engrossed as she was, Yuuho didn't realize that her[r]

Addressed by the uncle, Yuuho stepped down with[r]
disappointment and placed the gun back on the counter, but[r]
for us, it was more disappointing not to see Yuuho's bare[r]
legs and panties anymore.[pcms]

*2061|

Without correcting Yuuho's heated stance or mocking her, nor[r]
ignoring her, senpai just seemed to watch as if it were part[r]
of the scenery.[pcms]

*2062|
[fc]
In an environment where knowing how to protect oneself was[r]
necessary for survival, our senpai, who was only a year[r]

I can't just leave things as they are.[pcms]

*2110|
[fc]
I made up my mind immediately and turned back to Ren and[r]
Kousuke.[pcms]

*2111|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm going to the restroom for a bit, wait here with[r]
Kousuke."[pcms]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? O-Okay..."[pcms]

*2113|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"If you're going to the restroom, it's faster to go around[r]
the back than to wait for a portable one."[pcms]

*2114|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Idiot. How can I pee standing up in the middle of the[r]
shrine grounds? Anyway, take care of Ren for me."[pcms]

*2115|
[fc]
I said this quickly and chased after Yuuho, almost losing[r]
sight of her in the crowd.[pcms]

*2116|
[fc]
Yuuho walked without hesitation, her steps light.[pcms]

*2117|
[fc]
Their destination was... beneath that large cedar tree that[r]
was the subject of romantic rumors among the girls.[pcms]

[evcg storage="EV023a"][trans_c cross time=1000]

*2118|
[fc]
And the person who eagerly raised their hand towards Yuuho[r]
was indeed Oshima- senpai, as I thought.[pcms]

*2119|
[fc]
I was curious about what kind of conversation they were[r]
having, but because we were a bit away from the festival[r]
site and there were no people around, I couldn't get too[r]
close.[pcms]

*2120|
[fc]
Still, I strained my eyes and ears desperately trying to[r]
listen in, but all I could tell was that they were talking[r]
about something.[pcms]

*2121|
[fc]
Moreover, it was too dark for me to see their expressions.[pcms]

*2122|
[fc]
I wonder what it is. Is it really a confession?[pcms]

*2123|
[fc]
It's under the sacred tree where there are rumors of[r]
romance.[pcms]

*2124|
[fc]
A love confession... right?[pcms]

*2125|
[fc]
Feelings of denial and confusion crossed my mind, and I no[r]
longer knew what I wanted to do.[pcms]

*2126|
[fc]
All I could do was hold my breath and watch what happened[r]
between them.[pcms]

*2127|
[fc]
[pcms]

[evcg storage="EV023b"][trans_c cross time=300]

*2128|
[fc]
The silhouettes of the two started to move before my eyes.[pcms]

*2129|
[fc]
And then.[pcms]

;//カットインB
[evcg storage="EV023c"][trans_c cross time=300]

*2130|
[fc]
The shadows of their heads overlapped.[pcms]

*2131|
[fc]
They're kissing...[pcms]

*2132|
[fc]
In front of me, Yuuho is kissing a man who isn't me.[pcms]

*2133|
[fc]
And I stood there, unable to do anything about it.[pcms]

*2134|
[fc]
No... that's wrong! The one who should be kissing Yuuho, the[r]
one who should have been her first kiss, was supposed to be[r]
me.[pcms]

*2135|
[fc]
I couldn't bear it any longer and ran back to where Ren was[r]
as if fleeing from the scene.[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0097"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Ah, big brother, over here, over here!"[pcms]

*2137|
[fc]
Although I rushed over to Ren, who was sitting alone in[r]
front of the goldfish scooping stall near the shooting[r]
gallery we had parted from, I felt my legs shaking[r]
uncontrollably.[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*2138|
[fc]
Fortunately, Ren was so engrossed in goldfish scooping that[r]
she didn't notice my state.[pcms]

*2139|
[fc]
Kousuke was nowhere to be found, even though he said he'd[r]
look after Ren, but that was rather a relief for me.[pcms]

*2140|
[fc]
But...[pcms]

*2141|
[fc]
The scene I had just witnessed kept replaying in my head,[r]
making me feel dizzy enough to collapse.[pcms]

*2142|
[fc]
Maybe it would have been better not to go see it.[pcms]

*2143|
[fc]
After all, there's no guarantee that Yuuho's meeting was[r]
with Oshima-senpai; it could have been a female friend.[pcms]

*2144|
[fc]
I convinced myself of that and found the goldfish scooping[r]
stall nearby that Ren had been eager to try, pointing it out[r]
to her.[pcms]

*2145|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Then, since Yuuho might have trouble finding us if we're[r]
too far away, let's wait while doing some goldfish scooping[r]
over there."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2146|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0098"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yeah. This year I'm going to scoop them up properly♪"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2147|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Then I'll go buy some yakisoba. Oh, Ren-chan, would you[r]
prefer an apricot candy?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2148|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0099"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Thank you, Ko-chan. I'd like an orange one."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_a3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2149|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"OK. Wataru, is yakisoba fine for you too?"[pcms]

*2150|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2151|
[fc]
Kousuke, knowing our preferences from our childhood[r]
friendship, casually replied and then disappeared into the[r]
crowd toward the stall he was aiming for.[pcms]

*2152|
[fc]
Ren took out her wallet and received a scooping net,[r]
immediately becoming absorbed in goldfish scooping.[pcms]

*2153|
[fc]
But as usual, she couldn't scoop them up successfully.[pcms]

*2154|
[fc]
The sight seemed to symbolize me, unable to catch the freely[r]
swimming Yuuho, and my face turned pale.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_b4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2155|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0100"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yuuho-chan is late... The ranchu I'm aiming for is right[r]
there."[pcms]

*2156|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, yeah..."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2157|
[fc]
At Ren's words, I realized I had lost track of how much time[r]
had passed.[pcms]

*2158|
[fc]
If I was this worried, maybe I should have chased after her?[pcms]

;//〆：♪：believe　フェードアウト
[fadeoutbgm time=500]

*2159|
[fc]
But what if Oshima-senpai was the one who called out Yuuho?[pcms]

*2160|
[fc]
And what if the content of their meeting was indeed a[r]
confession?[pcms]

*2161|
[fc]
What if Yuuho accepted that confession?[pcms]

;//〆：♪：insomnia　フェードイン
[bgm storage="BGM06"]

*2162|
[fc]
No, she would definitely accept it. The other party is[r]
Oshima-senpai after all.[pcms]

*2163|
[fc]
Should I be supportive since he's more suited for her than I[r]
am?[pcms]

*2164|
[fc]
But it was supposed to be me who would date Yuuho; how did[r]
it end up like this?[pcms]

*2165|
[fc]
Negative thoughts swirled around in my head, and I felt like[r]
I might collapse at any moment.[pcms]

*2166|
[fc]
Just as my consciousness began to fade away, I saw Kousuke[r]
returning.[pcms]

*2167|
[fc]
In his hands were firmly held yakisoba and an orange candy[r]
coated with syrup, and he even managed to carry a shaved ice[r]
skillfully.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_a3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2168|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Sorry for the wait. The stalls were crowded."[pcms]

*2169|
[fc]
Kousuke came back with an excuse-like comment.[pcms]

*2170|
[fc]
But I was at my limit. I wanted to throw everything away and[r]
escape from this place as soon as possible.[pcms]

*2171|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Sorry, Kousuke, Ren. I'm going home first..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_b1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2172|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0101"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Big brother?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_a10"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2173|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Hey, hey, Wataru. What's wrong?"[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2174|
[fc]
I left them with only those words and turned on my heel to[r]
run away; Ren and Kousuke's voices chased after my[r]
retreating back.[pcms]

*2175|
[fc]
But I couldn't afford to look back at their voices.[pcms]

*2176|
[fc]
My vision was already blurring and becoming indistinct.[pcms]

*2177|
[fc]
Hot emotions turned into tears that overflowed and spilled[r]
from my eyes.[pcms]

*2178|
[fc]
I didn't want to meet anyone I knew anymore.[pcms]

*2179|
[fc]
With that single-minded determination, I dashed off like a[r]
startled rabbit towards the safety of my own bed at home[r]
where I could shut myself away alone.[pcms]
