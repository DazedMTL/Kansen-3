*880|
[fc]
The urban legend of the underground passage.[pcms]

*881|
[fc]
Part of the structure that extends from the current Yoyogi[r]
Park to Shibuya Station still exists, running beneath Kami-[r]
nan Academy...[pcms]

*882|
[fc]
My predictions had been confirmed as fact, and I couldn't[r]
help but let out a smile of joy. Now all that's left is to[r]
confirm it with my own eyes to make it perfect.[pcms]

*883|
[fc]
As I walked towards the entrance with a light step and in[r]
high spirits, the male students, as usual, tried to hit on[r]
me with their pickup lines.[pcms]

*884|
[fc]
However, I had no intention of engaging with them. I[r]
completely ignored those men as if they didn't exist.[pcms]

*885|
[fc]
The female students who saw this threw envious and jealous[r]
glances my way, whispering among themselves, but that too[r]
was just one of many meaningless noises.[pcms]

*886|
[fc]
Even so, I'm truly disappointed with the Japanese students.[pcms]

*887|
[fc]
I wasn't particularly expecting much, but their lack of[r]
discipline leaves me speechless.[pcms]

*888|
[fc]
Born in a privileged country, in a privileged environment,[r]
yet all that's on their minds is frivolous interaction with[r]
the opposite sex.[pcms]

*889|
[fc]
No ambition, no curiosity, just squandering their youth by[r]
taking advantage of a favorable environment.[pcms]

*890|
[fc]
Lacking in academic motivation, driven only by instinct.[r]
Above all, their understanding of their own culture and[r]
history is shallow, and they hardly have any patriotism...[pcms]

*891|
[fc]
The relationship between prosperity and decay is close, just[r]
as the philosopher said. It's a country that truly[r]
disappoints me to my core...[pcms]

*892|
[fc]
Is this really the student body of my mother's homeland?[pcms]

*893|
[fc]
At least my mother was nothing like these people. She was[r]
intellectual and kind, and she loved Japan... especially[r]
Shibuya, her hometown.[pcms]

*894|
[fc]
Shibuya, a city I visited only briefly as a child and never[r]
returned to since then.[pcms]

*895|
[fc]
My mother's longing for her hometown was never fulfilled;[r]
she became one of the departed this spring due to a bomb[r]
terrorist attack by the old military regime.[pcms]

*896|
[fc]
Longing for the image of my mother and the Shibuya she told[r]
me about, I persuaded my father, the ambassador to Japan, to[r]
let me come here.[pcms]

*897|
[fc]
Moreover, my father wanted me to graduate from a school in[r]
our home country and then study in the United States, but I[r]
insisted on coming here instead.[pcms]

*898|
[fc]
Japan was struck by a disaster a few years ago... a[r]
biohazard that weakened its national power.[pcms]

*899|
[fc]
It's hardly a safe or good country anymore, and it's losing[r]
its dignity as a developed nation.[pcms]

*900|
[fc]
Yet I came here eagerly... but now I can't help feeling[r]
disillusioned.[pcms]

*901|
[fc]
Gentle, intellectual, diligent, and rich in ambition. The[r]
Japanese people were supposed to be talented in embracing[r]
diverse cultures and evolving.[pcms]

*902|
[fc]
However, it seems that was all just my fantasy.[pcms]

*903|
[fc]
Despite these feelings, I decided to head to the library at[r]
Shibuya Palace to do some research.[pcms]

*904|
[fc]
In front of the academy stood a woman in black clothes out[r]
of place. It was Sesuka, in charge of my personal security.[r]
She seemed to be on the phone with someone...[pcms]

*905|
[fc]
It would be troublesome to be followed around here. I'm[r]
confident I can protect myself, so I moved to the back door[r]
to avoid being noticed.[pcms]
