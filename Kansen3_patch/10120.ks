*880|
[fc]
The urban legend of the underground passage.[pcms]

*881|
[fc]
Part of the structure that extends from the current Yoyogi Park to Shibuya[r]
Station still exists, running beneath Kami-nan Academy...[pcms]

*882|
[fc]
My predictions had been confirmed as fact, and I couldn't help but let out a[r]
smile of joy. Now all that's left is to confirm it with my own eyes to make it[r]
perfect.[pcms]

*883|
[fc]
As I walked towards the entrance with a light step and in high spirits, the male[r]
students, as usual, tried to hit on me with their pickup lines.[pcms]

*884|
[fc]
However, I had no intention of engaging with them. I completely ignored those[r]
men as if they didn't exist.[pcms]

*885|
[fc]
The female students who saw this threw envious and jealous glances my way,[r]
whispering among themselves, but that too was just one of many meaningless[r]
noises.[pcms]

*886|
[fc]
Even so, I'm truly disappointed with the Japanese students.[pcms]

*887|
[fc]
I wasn't particularly expecting much, but their lack of discipline leaves me[r]
speechless.[pcms]

*888|
[fc]
Born in a privileged country, in a privileged environment, yet all that's on[r]
their minds is frivolous interaction with the opposite sex.[pcms]

*889|
[fc]
No ambition, no curiosity, just squandering their youth by taking advantage of a[r]
favorable environment.[pcms]

*890|
[fc]
Lacking in academic motivation, driven only by instinct. Above all, their[r]
understanding of their own culture and history is shallow, and they hardly have[r]
any patriotism...[pcms]

*891|
[fc]
The relationship between prosperity and decay is close, just as the philosopher[r]
said. It's a country that truly disappoints me to my core...[pcms]

*892|
[fc]
Is this really the student body of my mother's homeland?[pcms]

*893|
[fc]
At least my mother was nothing like these people. She was intellectual and kind,[r]
and she loved Japan... especially Shibuya, her hometown.[pcms]

*894|
[fc]
Shibuya, a city I visited only briefly as a child and never returned to since[r]
then.[pcms]

*895|
[fc]
My mother's longing for her hometown was never fulfilled; she became one of the[r]
departed this spring due to a bomb terrorist attack by the old military regime.[pcms]

*896|
[fc]
Longing for the image of my mother and the Shibuya she told me about, I[r]
persuaded my father, the ambassador to Japan, to let me come here.[pcms]

*897|
[fc]
Moreover, my father wanted me to graduate from a school in our home country and[r]
then study in the United States, but I insisted on coming here instead.[pcms]

*898|
[fc]
Japan was struck by a disaster a few years ago... a biohazard that weakened its[r]
national power.[pcms]

*899|
[fc]
It's hardly a safe or good country anymore, and it's losing its dignity as a[r]
developed nation.[pcms]

*900|
[fc]
Yet I came here eagerly... but now I can't help feeling disillusioned.[pcms]

*901|
[fc]
Gentle, intellectual, diligent, and rich in ambition. The Japanese people were[r]
supposed to be talented in embracing diverse cultures and evolving.[pcms]

*902|
[fc]
However, it seems that was all just my fantasy.[pcms]

*903|
[fc]
Despite these feelings, I decided to head to the library at Shibuya Palace to do[r]
some research.[pcms]

*904|
[fc]
In front of the academy stood a woman in black clothes out of place. It was[r]
Sesuka, in charge of my personal security. She seemed to be on the phone with[r]
someone...[pcms]

*905|
[fc]
It would be troublesome to be followed around here. I'm confident I can protect[r]
myself, so I moved to the back door to avoid being noticed.[pcms]
