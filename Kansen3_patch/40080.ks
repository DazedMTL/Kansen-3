I slowly opened Yuuho's cell phone.[pcms]

*709|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Just a little... Just a quick look, that's all..."[pcms]

*710|
[fc]
My trembling fingers tried to open the mail inbox...[pcms]

*711|
[fc]
"Enter authentication key"[pcms]

*712|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...!"[pcms]

*713|
[fc]
I suddenly came to my senses at that message. I closed the cell phone as if it[r]
had been flung from my hands.[pcms]

*714|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I... what am I... doing right now?"[pcms]

*715|
[fc]
Even though I'm curious, to try and sneak a look at someone's cell phone!? What[r]
am I doing, what kind of thing am I...!?[pcms]

*716|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's just not right..."[pcms]

*717|
[fc]
If it hadn't asked for a passcode, would I have continued to invade Yuuho's[r]
privacy!?[pcms]

*718|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"What am I doing...?"[pcms]

*719|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai and Ren praised me earlier... but there's nothing cool about this![r]
I am... I am...![pcms]

*720|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm the worst..."[pcms]

*721|
[fc]
Feeling both pain and sadness, tears welled up in my eyes.[pcms]

*722|
[fc]
When I turned my gaze, I could vaguely see Yuuho lying down with her back turned[r]
towards me.[pcms]

*723|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...I'm sorry, Yuuho..."[pcms]

*724|
[fc]
Muttering an apology, I only borrowed the earphones and put the cell phone back[r]
where it was originally.[pcms]
