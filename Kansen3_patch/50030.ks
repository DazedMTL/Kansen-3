I took Ren and Yuuho with me and headed to the drugstore.[pcms]

"Ye-es. Excuse us for intruding."[pcms]

*170|
[fc]
After confirming there were no signs of people or 'them', we entered the store.[pcms]

*171|
[fc]
The store was a bit of a mess, but it looked more like the work of panicked[r]
humans than an attack by 'them'.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_yuh s="yuho1457"]

"Since it seemed like there was food at the 'depot', we don't need to take any[r]
for now, right?"[pcms]

*173|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah. I'm going to look for medicines and daily necessities. Ren, you'll need[r]
cream and contact lens supplies, right?"[pcms]

*174|
[fc]
When I reached out my hand and said "come here," Ren blushed for some reason and[r]
hesitated.[pcms]

[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Um... things like body soap and shampoo, you know."[pcms]

[fc]
Yuuho's tone was also hesitant.[pcms]

*179|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That sounds heavy. Should I carry it for you?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_yuh s="yuho1459"]

"No way! If I leave it to a guy, you'll pick something terrible without[r]
considering hair or skin type."[pcms]

"That's not true. I know Ren's favorites at least."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*182a|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...?? Okay, if you say so..."[pcms]

*183|
[fc]
For some reason, the two of them really wanted to act separately.[pcms]

*184|
[fc]
I watched the two sneak away...[pcms]

*185|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...I see."[pcms]

*186|
[fc]
The place they headed to was a corner with private brand underwear and menstrual[r]
products.[pcms]

*187|
[fc]
I guess that's definitely something they'd want to do separately...[pcms]

*188|
[fc]
Noticing my gaze, Yuuho turned around with incredible speed.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b13"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*189|

[vo_yuh s="yuho1461"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"...Don't follow us, okay?"[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*189a|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yes. As you wish."[pcms]

*190|
[fc]
I'm always impressed, but she really has an incredible intuition...[pcms]

*191|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well, that aside..."[pcms]

*192|
[fc]
I held shopping baskets in both hands and began to search through the shelves.[pcms]

*193|
[fc]
First, I packed as much as I could of the essentials like Ren's UV cut cream,[r]
contact lens solution, and eye drops into the basket.[pcms]

*194|
[fc]
In the other basket, I threw in anything that seemed useful that caught my eye,[r]
like wet wipes and painkillers.[pcms]

*195|
[fc]
Shopping (?) without any budget or restrictions gave me a strange sense of[r]
excitement... Even in this situation, I couldn't help feeling a bit elated.[pcms]

*196|
[fc]
The baskets were full in no time.[pcms]

*197|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I wonder how they're doing..."[pcms]

*198|
[fc]
When I looked up to check on them, Ren and Yuuho were picking out cosmetics. It[r]
seemed like they would take more time...[pcms]

*199|
[fc]
I decided to leave the store first, passing by the register with the baskets[r]
still in hand.[pcms]

*200|
[fc]
I also piled up some special sale snacks that were left at the storefront into[r]
the basket as an afterthought.[pcms]

As I stepped outside, I heard voices from afar.[pcms]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Hey~! If anyone can hear me, please respond~!"[pcms]

*204|
[fc]
I wonder where Senpai and Kousuke are walking. They seem to be within earshot at[r]
least.[pcms]

*205|
[fc]
I waited for Yuuho and the others to come out while absentmindedly looking up at[r]
the sky.[pcms]

*206|
[fc]
The sky was clear and blue...[pcms]

*207|
[fc]
A few planes were flying across the sky, trailing clouds behind them.[pcms]

*208|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Are those... fighter jets?"[pcms]

*209|
[fc]
They weren't Self-Defense Force planes but American military aircraft. The[r]
formation flew from in front of me over my head and disappeared into the[r]
distance.[pcms]

*210|
[fc]
This area isn't usually on any flight routes. Maybe they're heading from the[r]
ocean to some base... Or could it be a reconnaissance mission?[pcms]

*211|
[fc]
But at least it's been a while since I've seen evidence that living humans are[r]
still active...[pcms]

*212|
[fc]
The outside world is still functioning... maybe. If we wait a little longer,[r]
will the situation be resolved and help arrive... maybe.[pcms]

"Is nobody there? Hey! Yoo-hoo!?"[pcms]

*215|
[fc]
As I was idly thinking about such things, the voices of Senpai and Kousuke[r]
calling out continued to echo in the distance through the streets lined with[r]
buildings.[pcms]

Finally, Yuuho and Ren came out of the store.[pcms]

*219|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wow, that's amazing..."[pcms]

*220|
[fc]
Yuuho had baskets full of goods in both hands, and on top of that, she was[r]
carrying bundles of toilet paper (the economical 12-roll pack) bound together[r]
with tape.[pcms]

*221|
[fc]
As for Ren, she had less because she was carrying a violin case, but like Yuuho,[r]
she was also holding bundles of tissues and baskets.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well, it's an emergency situation, so it can't be helped."[pcms]

*225|
[fc]
The safety of the city hasn't been clearly confirmed, and it would be difficult[r]
to come to this store many times... With that in mind, stocking up on supplies[r]
all at once is the right decision.[pcms]

*226|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Shall we head back... Hm?"[pcms]

As I casually looked around, something like a shadow caught my eye.[pcms]

From the street leading to the station front, I could see Senpai Maruko and[r]

infected![pcms]

We all started running towards the depot at once.[pcms]

Suddenly catching up, Senpai and Kousuke rushed towards Yuuho and Ren.[pcms]

I instinctively looked back to see a large swarm of infected coming from the[r]
direction of the station, swarming towards us.[pcms]

Not only that, but new infected were continuously emerging from inside the[r]
