I took Ren and Yuuho with me and headed to the drugstore.[pcms]

"Ye-es. Excuse us for intruding."[pcms]

*170|
[fc]
After confirming there were no signs of people or 'them', we[r]
entered the store.[pcms]

*171|
[fc]
The store was a bit of a mess, but it looked more like the[r]
work of panicked humans than an attack by 'them'.[pcms]

"Since it seemed like there was food at the 'depot', we[r]
don't need to take any for now, right?"[pcms]

*173|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah. I'm going to look for medicines and daily[r]
necessities. Ren, you'll need cream and contact lens[r]
supplies, right?"[pcms]

*174|
[fc]
When I reached out my hand and said "come here," Ren blushed[r]
for some reason and hesitated.[pcms]

Yuuho's tone was also hesitant.[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That sounds heavy. Should I carry it for you?"[pcms]

[vo_yuh s="yuho1459"]

"No way! If I leave it to a guy, you'll pick something[r]
terrible without considering hair or skin type."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]

*182a|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...?? Okay, if you say so..."[pcms]

*183|
[fc]
For some reason, the two of them really wanted to act[r]
separately.[pcms]

*184|
[fc]
I watched the two sneak away...[pcms]

*185|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...I see."[pcms]

*186|
[fc]
The place they headed to was a corner with private brand[r]
underwear and menstrual products.[pcms]

*187|
[fc]
I guess that's definitely something they'd want to do[r]
separately...[pcms]

*188|
[fc]
Noticing my gaze, Yuuho turned around with incredible speed.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b13"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"...Don't follow us, okay?"[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yes. As you wish."[pcms]

*190|
[fc]
I'm always impressed, but she really has an incredible[r]
intuition...[pcms]

*191|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well, that aside..."[pcms]

*192|
[fc]
I held shopping baskets in both hands and began to search[r]
through the shelves.[pcms]

*193|
[fc]
First, I packed as much as I could of the essentials like[r]
Ren's UV cut cream, contact lens solution, and eye drops[r]
into the basket.[pcms]

*194|
[fc]
In the other basket, I threw in anything that seemed useful[r]
that caught my eye, like wet wipes and painkillers.[pcms]

*195|
[fc]
Shopping (?) without any budget or restrictions gave me a[r]
strange sense of excitement... Even in this situation, I[r]
couldn't help feeling a bit elated.[pcms]

*196|
[fc]
The baskets were full in no time.[pcms]

*197|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I wonder how they're doing..."[pcms]

*198|
[fc]
When I looked up to check on them, Ren and Yuuho were[r]
picking out cosmetics. It seemed like they would take more[r]
time...[pcms]

*199|
[fc]
I decided to leave the store first, passing by the register[r]
with the baskets still in hand.[pcms]

*200|
[fc]
I also piled up some special sale snacks that were left at[r]
the storefront into the basket as an afterthought.[pcms]

As I stepped outside, I heard voices from afar.[pcms]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Hey~! If anyone can hear me, please respond~!"[pcms]

*204|
[fc]
I wonder where Senpai and Kousuke are walking. They seem to[r]
be within earshot at least.[pcms]

*205|
[fc]
I waited for Yuuho and the others to come out while[r]
absentmindedly looking up at the sky.[pcms]

The sky was clear and blue...[pcms]

*207|
[fc]
A few planes were flying across the sky, trailing clouds[r]
behind them.[pcms]

*208|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Are those... fighter jets?"[pcms]

*209|
[fc]
They weren't Self-Defense Force planes but American military[r]
aircraft. The formation flew from in front of me over my[r]
head and disappeared into the distance.[pcms]

*210|
[fc]
This area isn't usually on any flight routes. Maybe they're[r]
heading from the ocean to some base... Or could it be a[r]
reconnaissance mission?[pcms]

*211|
[fc]
But at least it's been a while since I've seen evidence that[r]
living humans are still active...[pcms]

*212|
[fc]
The outside world is still functioning... maybe. If we wait[r]
a little longer, will the situation be resolved and help[r]
arrive... maybe.[pcms]

"Is nobody there? Hey! Yoo-hoo!?"[pcms]

*215|
[fc]
As I was idly thinking about such things, the voices of[r]
Senpai and Kousuke calling out continued to echo in the[r]
distance through the streets lined with buildings.[pcms]

*219|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wow, that's amazing..."[pcms]

*220|
[fc]
Yuuho had baskets full of goods in both hands, and on top of[r]
that, she was carrying bundles of toilet paper (the[r]
economical 12-roll pack) bound together with tape.[pcms]

*221|
[fc]
As for Ren, she had less because she was carrying a violin[r]
case, but like Yuuho, she was also holding bundles of[r]
tissues and baskets.[pcms]

"Well, it's an emergency situation, so it can't be helped."[pcms]

*225|
[fc]
The safety of the city hasn't been clearly confirmed, and it[r]
would be difficult to come to this store many times... With[r]
that in mind, stocking up on supplies all at once is the[r]
right decision.[pcms]

*226|

As I casually looked around, something like a shadow caught[r]

From the street leading to the station front, I could see[r]

momentum. Behind them surged a horde of infected![pcms]

We all started running towards the depot at once.[pcms]

I instinctively looked back to see a large swarm of infected[r]

us.[pcms]
