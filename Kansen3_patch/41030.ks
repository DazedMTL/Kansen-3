*2442|

The senior seems to deeply regret forgetting her cellphone.[pcms]

*2443|
[fc]
Given that the senior is a diplomat's daughter, her[r]
cellphone might be special, perhaps containing numbers that[r]
could be of help in a rescue.[pcms]

*2444|

[vo_mar s="maru0326"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Well, there's no use crying over spilt milk now. The need[r]

"We're short on food, and no matter how hard we try, we only[r]
have enough water for two days. I've heard that similar[r]
disturbances in the past were suppressed within a few days,[r]
but with our current supplies, we won't last that long."[pcms]

"We could survive for about a week just by living. But[r]
there's no guarantee that someone will come to rescue us. If[r]
that's the case, we'll definitely starve to death here."[pcms]

*2448|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Is that so..."[pcms]

*2449|
[fc]
I suddenly thought that if we had the cellphone, the[r]

so, Wataru, it's impressive you managed to escape with all[r]
this luggage, even if it was just for camping."[pcms]

"Maybe it was adrenaline or a runner's high...? I only[r]
realized the luggage was heavy after Maruko-senpai mentioned[r]
it earlier."[pcms]

"Absolutely. I couldn't do it again if you asked me to."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Then, why don't we start by eating this? It's well past[r]
lunchtime."[pcms]

*2457|
[fc]
I offered the bento box that Ren had given me.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"By the way, what about that bento box?"[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren... my sister made it for me."[pcms]

"..."[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0333"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Is that okay?"[pcms]

*2462|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"It's fine. It'll spoil if we don't eat it soon."[pcms]

"No, I didn't mean it like that..."[pcms]

[vo_yuh s="yuho0213"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Wataru..."[pcms]

*2465|

Yuuho looked at me with eyes that seemed to say, "Is that[r]
okay?"[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*2466|
[fc]
I knew what Margarita wanted to say. In the worst-case[r]
scenario, this could be the last homemade meal Ren left for[r]
me.[pcms]

*2467|
[fc]
The two of them were suggesting that maybe I should eat it[r]
alone.[pcms]

*2468|
[fc]
I was surprised by Margarita. I thought she was always[r]
logical, but she understood people's delicate feelings as[r]
well.[pcms]

*2469|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren would be happy if we all shared it. Yuuho, of course,[r]
and Margarita too since you helped me before."[pcms]

*2470|
[fc]
In times like these, I thought we should share and eat the[r]
bento together.[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=1000][hide_chara_int]

*2471|
[fc]
The meal was less about satisfying hunger and more about[r]
savoring memories.[pcms]

*2472|
[fc]
Honestly, I had no appetite.[pcms]

*2473|
[fc]
I ate simply with the feeling of "I must eat now," knowing I[r]
might never taste Ren's homemade cooking again.[pcms]

*2474|
[fc]
After Maruko-senpai's story about forgetting her cellphone[r]
earlier, I finally checked mine which I hadn't looked at for[r]
a while.[pcms]

*2475|
[fc]
To my surprise, even underground here, the cellphone signal[r]
was working. But maybe the lines were messed up because I[r]
couldn't get through on the phone.[pcms]

*2476|
[fc]
I sent emails to Ren, Kousuke, and Dad even though I thought[r]
it was futile, but all of them failed to send.[pcms]

*2477|
[fc]
I decided to check the unread emails that had come in.[pcms]

*2478|
[fc]
I hadn't checked my own emails first, perhaps because I had[r]
been listening to Maruko-senpai saying there's no use[r]
regretting the past.[pcms]

*2479|
[fc]
The emails were from Ren and Kousuke, sent during the summer[r]
festival. Around the time I was talking with Inori-san.[pcms]

*2480|
[fc]
"Hey, where did you disappear to?" and "Big brother, where[r]
are you?"[pcms]

*2481|
[fc]
Short messages of concern for me who had run away from the[r]
summer festival.[pcms]

*2482|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ugh..."[pcms]

*2483|
[fc]
Even though I had cried my heart out earlier, tears started[r]
to well up again.[pcms]

*2484|
[fc]
They cared about me so much... And yet, I couldn't save[r]
them.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2485|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0214"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"...Wataru..."[pcms]

*2486|
[fc]
Yuuho looked at me worriedly.[pcms]

*2487|
[fc]
That's right. I must not give up hope. It's not decided yet[r]
that I won't see them again.[pcms]

*2488|
[fc]
I have to believe that Kousuke is managing well as Yuuho[r]
said. If I don't believe, it will surely become true.[pcms]

*2490|
[fc]
I hurriedly opened the email.[pcms]

*2491|
[fc]
I thought it was from Ren, but the email was from Dad.[pcms]

*2492|
[fc]
It was received quite late, but the date was today's.[pcms]

*2493|
[fc]
There's a big commotion. It seems to be related to that[r]
infection in the northeast. The vaccine doesn't seem to be[r]
working.[pcms]

*2494|
[fc]
Is the school okay? Are there any infected? If there are,[r]
don't go near them.[pcms]

*2495|
[fc]
Even if it's a friend. It's harsh, but once infected,[r]
there's no hope for recovery. That's how it was with the[r]
virus in the northeast.[pcms]

*2496|
[fc]
Anyway, just think about protecting yourself first.[pcms]

*2497|
[fc]
I'll be on a broadcast soon.[pcms]

*2498|
[fc]
Take care of Ren.[pcms]

*2499|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Dad..."[pcms]

*2500|
[fc]
I swallowed the word "sorry" that I was about to say next,[r]
along with the tears that were welling up.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"From your uncle?"[pcms]

*2502|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah. He says he's safe. He's going to cover a story now.[r]
It's a bit of an old email though."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2503|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0335"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Covering a story? Is Wataru's father a journalist or[r]
something?"[pcms]

*2504|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"He's a reporter for DHK."[pcms]

*2505|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0336"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"I see. You might receive direct transmissions of useful[r]
information then."[pcms]

*2506|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"The reception is quite delayed though."[pcms]

*2507|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0337"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"There's also radio. If it's even a little faster and[r]
accurate, it's worth a lot."[pcms]

*2508|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's true..."[pcms]

*2509|
[fc]
If the radio is broadcasting incorrect information, we can[r]
verify it with Dad's information.[pcms]

[vo_mar s="maru0338"]

"It seems there's no radio broadcast right now. For now,[r]
emails are the only way to know what's happening outside."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yuuho, did you get any emails?"[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0216"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Yeah. From friends at other schools. They say things are[r]
pretty bad, but they're asking if I'm okay."[pcms]

*2514|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0217"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Mostly from other prefectures. Oh, and one from inside[r]
Tokyo, but it's quite far out in the suburbs..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2515|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0218"]

"Nothing from nearby... Neither from Dad nor Mom..."[pcms]

*2516|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0340"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...I see."[pcms]

*2517|
[fc]
The senior seemed to look down as if regretting asking such[r]
a question.[pcms]

*2518|
[fc]
Yuuho must be worried about her uncle and aunt too... Come[r]
to think of it, what about the senior?[pcms]

*2519|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Are your parents okay, senior? They're at the embassy,[r]
right?"[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...I'm sorry."[pcms]

*2524|
[fc]
A sharp pain struck my heart. The senior had experienced the[r]
same suffering as me.[pcms]

*2525|
[fc]
"To have one's mother taken away for such an absurd[r]
reason..."[pcms]

*2526|
[fc]
The pain the senior is feeling now must surely be the same[r]
as what I felt just a moment ago.[pcms]

[vo_mar s="maru0344"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Don't worry about it. It's an unavoidable pain when people[r]
try to understand each other."[pcms]

*2529|
[fc]
The senior smiled kindly at me. It was the expression I[r]
often made when I felt the same pain.[pcms]

*2530|
[fc]
Enduring the pain, with a feeling of "thank you" for those[r]
who showed concern...[pcms]

*2531|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm truly sorry!"[pcms]

I bowed my head once again.[pcms]

[vo_mar s="maru0347"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Well, they should be managing somehow. Capable soldiers[r]
show their true worth in situations like this."[pcms]

*2536|

The senior said this to reassure us, but at the same time,[r]
it sounded like she was saying that our country's Self-[r]
Defense Forces were not up to par.[pcms]

;//@konya char_clear
[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*2537|
[fc]
In fact, during the northeast infection disaster, there were[r]
rumors that some units had panicked in fear and engaged in[r]
friendly fire, which the media criticized as a waste of tax[r]
money.[pcms]

*2538|
[fc]
The only ones who didn't do that were my father's colleagues[r]
at DHK, the national broadcaster.[pcms]

*2539|
[fc]
I was about to blame the Self-Defense Forces for my mother[r]
not coming home, but it seems my father said, "You mustn't[r]
do that..."[pcms]

*2540|
[fc]
I stopped thinking that way.[pcms]

*2541|

Ah, now that I think about it...[pcms]
