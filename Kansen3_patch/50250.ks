"But hey, you said they were 'moving to the suburbs'... Yet[r]
there were swarms of them on the streets, weren't there?"[pcms]

"Compared to the usual streets of Shibuya, it was a modest[r]
number. Considering Tokyo's population, that is."[pcms]

Having not participated in the conversation until now, Jin,[r]
who had been blankly staring at the monitor, opened his[r]
mouth with curiosity.[pcms]

"The streets... Which area are you talking about?"[pcms]

"It's the Q Building across from here."[pcms]

He didn't go into much detail (probably corporate secrets),[r]
but Jin said that they used an underground passage on their[r]
way from Celesta Tower to LASER.[pcms]

*1454|
[fc]
Just like Hiko-chin's gang's hideout 'Dedepou', Jin's gang's[r]
hideout 'Q Building' might also have an entrance connected[r]
to Udagawa's underground drainage... perhaps.[pcms]

all over the place!"[pcms]

Kousuke looked unconvinced, but indeed, when we left[r]
'Dedepou', there was no one in the streets.[pcms]

*1458|
[fc]
The infected started pouring out after we started moving[r]
around...?[pcms]

*1459|
[fc]
But we didn't walk a long distance, and if it's just about[r]
moving, Jin and his group did the same.[pcms]

*1460|
[fc]
The only difference between our actions and Jin's group's[r]
could be...[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Could it be... that thing?"[pcms]

*1462|

I remember calling out to see if there were any survivors.[pcms]

out loudly."[pcms]

We were utterly laughed at through his nose...[pcms]
