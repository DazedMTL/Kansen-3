The light from the window woke me up, and I reached out for the alarm clock.[pcms]

*1391|
[fc]
The time was about to hit noon, but instead of getting up, I tried to dive back[r]
under the towel blanket to block out the sunlight.[pcms]

*1392|
[fc]
It's summer vacation... and today there's no club activities or school to[r]
attend.[pcms]

*1393|
[fc]
At times like this, wanting to sleep to your heart's content is just human[r]
nature.[pcms]

*1394|
[fc]
Yeah, yeah, nodding to myself, I was about to fall back asleep when the word[r]
"club" flashed across my mind.[pcms]

*1395|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's right... I was asked to buy a lantern and an electronic insect[r]
repellent."[pcms]

*1396|
[fc]
We're leaving for camp tomorrow, so I have to go today or it won't be in time.[pcms]

*1397|
[fc]
Plus, I'm holding onto the club funds for the purchase, so "I forgot" won't cut[r]
it.[pcms]

*1398|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Can't be helped, I'll get up."[pcms]

*1399|
[fc]
I told myself and got out of bed to start preparing to go out.[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Lanterns at Toyo Hand, insect repellent at Giga Camera... Which route is more[r]
efficient?"[pcms]

*1401|
[fc]
Muttering to myself, I headed to the living room, and despite the time, nobody[r]
was there.[pcms]

*1402|
[fc]
The bag that dad always takes with him when he says he's going on an interview[r]
was thrown on the sofa.[pcms]

*1403|
[fc]
It seems dad hasn't left yet...[pcms]

*1404|
[fc]
Last night, he said he wouldn't be late, but as expected, he was, so maybe he's[r]
still sleeping.[pcms]

*1405|
[fc]
The real work starts in the evening anyway.[pcms]

*1406|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Is Ren at her club activities?"[pcms]

*1407|
[fc]
As I peeked into the kitchen and approached the dining table, for some reason,[r]
there were two packs of instant curry and a note left by Ren.[pcms]

*1408|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Let's see... 'Warm up the curry for lunch! I'll be back around 2 or 3 PM.' So,[r]
this is the lunch curry!"[pcms]

*1409|
[fc]
Is this an act of love for dad who wanted curry, or is it spite because I said[r]
we should have somen noodles instead since we're having curry at camp?[pcms]

*1410|
[fc]
Either way, it's true that curry is likely to be on tomorrow's camp menu.[pcms]

*1411|
[fc]
I silently took out an egg from the fridge and made myself tamago kake gohan[r]
with the rice Ren had cooked for breakfast-cum-lunch.[pcms]

*1412|
[fc]
Using the space on Ren's note, I wrote that I was going shopping and then burst[r]
out of the house into the hot sunlight.[pcms]

;//〆：BG：四つ葉町住宅街
[bg storage="BG02a"][trans_c cross time=500]
;[eval exp="f.l_map = 3"]

*1413|
[fc]
But... inside the cool house and outside feel like there's an invisible barrier[r]
between them.[pcms]

*1414|
[fc]
If I don't buy what I was asked for, I'll definitely get strangled by the club[r]
president and tomorrow will be my death anniversary.[pcms]

*1415|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Sigh..."[pcms]

*1416|
[fc]
Stepping onto the scorching asphalt, I decided to head to Giga Camera near the[r]
station first and started walking.[pcms]

*1417|
[fc]
[ns]Neighborhood Auntie[nse]
"Oh my, isn't that Wataru? Good morning!"[pcms]

*1418|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? Oh, good morning."[pcms]

*1419|
[fc]
[ns]Neighborhood Auntie[nse]
"It's so hot out, where are you off to?"[pcms]

*1420|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well, just to the station area to buy some supplies for club activities."[pcms]

*1421|
[fc]
[ns]Neighborhood Auntie[nse]
"Well, good luck with that."[pcms]

*1422|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"No problem. Excuse me then."[pcms]

*1423|
[fc]
I quickly escaped from the auntie with a polite smile plastered on my face.[pcms]

*1424|
[fc]
If you get caught by her, she can easily hold you up for an hour or two with[r]
neighborhood gossip.[pcms]

*1425|
[fc]
And if you brush her off rudely, next thing you know your family becomes the[r]
talk of the town...[pcms]

*1426|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Sigh..."[pcms]

*1427|
[fc]
A different kind of sigh spilled from my lips this time.[pcms]

*1428|
[fc]
The heat from the blazing sun seemed to double in intensity.[pcms]

*1429|
[fc]
Still, I pushed through my lethargy and headed towards the center of Shibuya.[pcms]

*1430|
[fc]
The asphalt seemed to waver in a haze from the heat, and everyone walking by[r]
looked hot... wait, what?[pcms]

*1431|
[fc]
I could see someone walking along who seemed cut off from the season of summer,[r]
looking cool and composed.[pcms]

*1432|
[fc]
Is that Inori-san?[pcms]

*1433|
[fc]
Yeah. It definitely is.[pcms]

*1434|
[fc]
She's Tadahiko's girlfriend Inori-san.[pcms]

*1435|
[fc]
Tadahiko may be involved in that certain "profession," but to us he's a reliable[r]
older brother figure we've known since childhood.[pcms]

*1436|
[fc]
Inori-san met him when he went on a job to Kansai and came back with him.[pcms]

*1437|
[fc]
I don't know if they'll end up getting married or not.[pcms]

*1438|
[fc]
Even from a distance, she looks cool and dignified yet naturally exudes a[r]
bewitching aura...[pcms]

*1439|
[fc]
The allure of her charm has drawn in customers who frequently visit, and thanks[r]
to that, the popular eatery "Otowa" that Inori-san runs is thriving.[pcms]

*1440|
[fc]
Rumor has it that not only locals but also customers from other prefectures come[r]
to visit, and seeing Inori-san, I can't help but believe those rumors might all[r]
be true.[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0001"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"Oh, Wataru. What's wrong? If you stand around in such a place, you'll get[r]
heatstroke."[pcms]

*1442|
[fc]
Being addressed in her gentle Kyoto dialect, I almost melted away, but I looked[r]
at Inori-san with renewed respect.[pcms]

*1443|
[fc]
Of course, the only one I love is Yuuho, but in front of this melting[r]
bewitchment, even I would probably visit Inori-san's shop every night if I had[r]
the money.[pcms]

*1444|
[fc]
Of course, I know it's presumptuous of me to even think of standing beside her,[r]
but still, there's something about the charm of an older woman...[pcms]

*1445|
[fc]
The bewitching scent of a woman that healthy Yuuho doesn't have honestly makes a[r]
man like me react.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1446|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0002"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"My goodness, Wataru. Are you really suffering from heatstroke?"[pcms]

*1447|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? No... I was just admiring how you manage to look so cool and composed[r]
despite the heat."[pcms]

*1448|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0003"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"What are you talking about? Of course, I'm hot too. But not showing it is what[r]
you call pride."[pcms]

*1449|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Pride...you say?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1450|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0004"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"Pride or maybe stubbornness. It would look bad to be all sluggish just because[r]
it's hot, right?"[pcms]

*1451|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0005"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"Especially when it's hot, isn't it better to appear cool and composed?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1452|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I see."[pcms]

*1453|
[fc]
While nodding at Inori-san's words, I might not have understood even half of[r]
what she meant.[pcms]

*1454|
[fc]
Sure, it might look bad to be sluggish just because it's hot, but when it's hot,[r]
it's hotthere's no helping it.[pcms]

*1455|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0006"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"But really, Wataru, what were you actually doing in such a place?"[pcms]

*1456|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I was on my way to the station to do some shopping... and when I saw Inori-san,[r]
I waited for you. Where are you headed?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1457|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0007"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"Oh, how sweet of you to say. I'm actually heading to the station too. Tadahiko[r]
is coming back home, so I'm going to meet him."[pcms]

*1458|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, Hiko-chin was away for work in Kansai, wasn't he?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1459|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0008"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"That's right. He said on the phone that he bought lots of souvenirs, so we[r]
should all get together when we have time."[pcms]

*1460|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yes, I'll visit with everyone when we find a convenient time soon."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1461|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0009"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"Really now. Oh no, I left early to make it on time for his arrival, but[r]
Tadahiko might get there before me."[pcms]

*1462|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Then shall we go to the station together?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1463|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0010"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"That would be nice."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1464|
[fc]
Smiling sweetly as she started walking, I followed behind Inori-san as if[r]
accompanying her.[pcms]

*1465|
[fc]
Inori-san seemed happy that Hiko-chin was coming back; she talked about him the[r]
whole time.[pcms]

*1466|
[fc]
Hiko-chin is really lucky to have such a girlfriend.[pcms]

*1467|
[fc]
I wonder if someday I'll date such a wonderful woman or even marry one?[pcms]

*1468|
[fc]
"If only that person could be Yuuho," I thought to myself.[pcms]

*1469|
[fc]
The moment I thought that, my face must have turned bright red because Inori-[r]
san's face clouded over with suspicion as she was happily talking about Hiko-[r]
chin.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1470|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0011"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"Oh dear. Your face is all red, Wataru. You're not really getting heatstroke,[r]
are you?"[pcms]

*1471|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? No...it's just that..."[pcms]

*1472|
[fc]
I couldn't very well say that fantasizing about marrying Yuuho made me blush, so[r]
I looked around frantically for something to say to cover up.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1473|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0012"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"Really, if you're feeling unwell just say so. If something happens to you while[r]
I'm with you, Tadahiko will scold me."[pcms]

*1474|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm fine..."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1475|
[fc]
Just as I was about to say that, I caught sight of Yuuho out of the corner of my[r]
eye.[pcms]

*1476|
[fc]
It seems we had inadvertently come close to the public diner "Kannagi" run by[r]
Yuuho's family.[pcms]

*1477|
[fc]
Seeing her in her uniform, she seems to be on her way to her club activities in[r]
the afternoon.[pcms]

*1478|
[fc]
But still...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1479|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0013"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"Oh, isn't that Yuuho? ...And who's that handsome guy next to her? He looks[r]
quite dashing."[pcms]

*1480|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's Oshima-senpai. He's the ace of our school's tennis club..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="iori_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=145 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1481|
[fc]
[vo_ior s="iori0014"]
[ns]Inori[nse]
"With that face and being the tennis club ace, he must be quite popular with the[r]
girls."[pcms]

*1482|
[fc]
As Inori-san said, Oshima-senpai is known as the most handsome guy in school and[r]
is very popular among the girls.[pcms]

*1483|
[fc]
The area around the tennis court is always crowded with girls there just for[r]
Oshima-senpai; he's that well-known throughout the school.[pcms]

*1484|
[fc]
But why is Oshima-senpai with Yuuho?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1485|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0050"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Huh? Wataru and Inori-san?"[pcms]

*1486|
[fc]
Even though Yuuho was the same as always, just seeing her talking happily with[r]
Oshima-senpai made me unsure how to approach them.[pcms]

*1487|
[fc]
Despite my hesitation, Yuuho casually called out to me.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="oshima_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=135 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1488|
[fc]
[ns]Oshimi[nse]
"Hm? Wataru... could it be Ayase Wataru-kun from the Astronomy Club?"[pcms]

*1489|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yes, that's right... But why does senpai know my name?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="oshima_a3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=135 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1490|
[fc]
[ns]Oshimi[nse]
"I'm a bit interested in space myself, so I've been checking out the Astronomy[r]
Club's website. I'm especially a fan of the columns about exoplanets that Ayase-[r]
kun writes."[pcms]

*1491|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Is that so? Thank you very much."[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="oshima_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=135 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1492|
[fc]
[ns]Oshimi[nse]
"Your unique perspective, while still considering previous theories, makes it[r]
more interesting than some magazine columns. The next one is about Aldebaran,[r]
right? I'm looking forward to it."[pcms]

*1493|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Haa..."[pcms]

*1494|
[fc]
The refreshing smile befitting the school's most handsome guy was so dazzling[r]
that I ended up giving a somewhat silly response.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="oshima_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=135 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1495|
[fc]
[ns]Oshimi[nse]
"Oops, I better get going or I won't have time to grab lunch before club[r]
activities... Well then, I'll be taking my leave."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_b4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1496|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0051"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Yes, senpai."[pcms]

*1497|
[fc]
[ns]Oshimi[nse]
"Kaminagi-san, Ayase-kun. See you around at school."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1498|
[fc]
Even from a guy's perspective, the way he turned on his heel to leave was[r]
cool...[pcms]

*1499|
[fc]
And with Yuuho sending him off with a bright smile, my heart sank to rock[r]
bottom.[pcms]

*1500|
[fc]
Comparing myself to Oshima-senpai is presumptuous, I know, but when it involves[r]
a girl I like, it's a different story.[pcms]

*1501|
[fc]
I couldn't help but stare intently, wondering if Yuuho prefers someone like[r]
Oshima-senpai... Did she notice my gaze, looking at me with a puzzled[r]
expression?[pcms]

*1502|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Is something wrong?"[pcms]

[ns]Inori[nse]
"That might be nice. Maybe it's good to go on a date with younger folks once in[r]
a while. Yuuho was in a good mood with that boy just now too, so how about a[r]
double date?"[pcms]

[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"A good mood? I just got asked for my email by Oshima-senpai, that's all."[pcms]

*1508|
[fc]
Though she said it jokingly, Inori-san's answer included a question I could[r]
never dare to ask myself, and my heart skipped a beat for a moment.[pcms]

*1509|
[fc]
But Yuuho's answer was clear and decisive, and I let out a sigh of relief.[pcms]

Inori-san's gentle voice seemed like a signal, and we walked together to the[r]

her bicycle.[pcms]

*1519|
[fc]
I was more than happy about it, and Inori-san didn't seem to mind either.[pcms]

*1520|
[fc]
Plus, while Yuuho and Inori-san were chatting, I could think to myself.[pcms]

*1521|
[fc]
I was very curious whether the exchange with Oshima-senpai was really just about[r]
email addresses.[pcms]

*1522|
[fc]
But probing too much would be creepy...[pcms]

*1523|
[fc]
The last thing I want is to confess clumsily and ruin this comfortable[r]
relationship we have as childhood friends.[pcms]

*1524|
[fc]
I don't want to stay in this relationship forever.[pcms]

*1525|
[fc]
But still...[pcms]

Even if they didn't speak up, there were younger boys discussing the two of them[r]
and husbands getting nudged by their wives for staring a bit too long.[pcms]

*1552|
[fc]
Following behind them like an escort, I noticed that although the number of[r]
people who spoke up wasn't much different, Yuuho was definitely greeted more[r]
evenly by people of all ages and genders.[pcms]

*1553|
[fc]
Perhaps it's because Inori-san usually works at night and isn't as familiar to[r]
women and children, but Yuuho really is the town's star of hope.[pcms]

*1554|
[fc]
That was evident from the "Go for it! Yuuho Kanagi" banners and words of[r]
encouragement for Yuuho posted all over the shopping district.[pcms]

*1555|
[fc]
Even without seeing those, just walking these ten or so meters made it clear...[pcms]

;//キャラ消し

I once again confirmed that Yuuho is indeed a popular figure.[pcms]

Thinking about it, being asked for her email address by a senior isn't such a[r]
big deal...[pcms]

*1558|
[fc]
Even if that senior happens to be Oshima-senpai, the most handsome guy at[r]
school, it's not something to fuss over just because I happened to witness it.[pcms]

*1559|
[fc]
After all, Yuuho's phone already has contacts ranging from TV personalities to[r]
important figures in the swimming association and even boys from the swim[r]

The last time she showed me was quite a while ago, so there might even be more[r]
now.[pcms]

Convincing myself of that, I finally regained my composure.[pcms]

After passing through the shopping district and approaching the fork in the road[r]
towards the station and school, Yuuho murmured quietly.[pcms]

*1565|
[fc]
I can't quite understand since I'm not someone who's expected to do much, but I[r]
guess for someone like Yuuho who has expectations placed on her from both inside[r]

"What do you mean 'Wataru actually'?"[pcms]

Indeed, Inori-san's words made me realize that I needed to offer Yuuho a[r]
different kind of support than the expectant cheers everyone else was giving[r]
her.[pcms]

*1572|
[fc]
I don't think there's any need to say 'Wataru actually said something sensible.'[pcms]

*1573|

Inori-san saved me from my momentary dejection with a laugh.[pcms]

"But it's been a while since I've seen Yuuho, and it would be a shame to part[r]

school on our way to the station?"[pcms]

"That's fine by me. But won't you be late to pick up Hiko-chin?"[pcms]

*1577|

Hearing Inori-san's answer, both Yuuho and I felt reluctant to part ways after[r]
having such a rare chance to talk with her.[pcms]

*1578|

So without any objections, we headed towards the school.[pcms]

Unlike me, Kousuke is not only musically talented but also so athletic that he's[r]
called upon to help out the basketball team.[pcms]

He's friendly and has a wide social circle, participates in neighborhood watch[r]

Our relationship with Tadahiko hasn't changed since we were kids, even though[r]
he's now part of a special corporation that has jurisdiction over this area.[pcms]

*1714|
[fc]
There are people who might look at us strangely for hanging out with someone[r]
like Tadahiko, and it seems he himself doesn't want his work discussed where his[r]
subordinates are present, so we've been keeping our distance.[pcms]

*1715|

However, we pretended to chat casually in front of "LASER" while waiting for an[r]
opportunity.[pcms]

Suddenly, conversations like "Is everything ready for the festival?" reached our[r]
ears.[pcms]

Since this area is Tadahiko's territory, naturally, the management of the food[r]
stalls we planned to visit tonight falls under his company's jurisdiction.[pcms]

The subordinate quickly finished checking on the preparations and returned to[r]

The person Tadahiko calls 'old man' is the executive managing director of his[r]

The shrine I've been familiar with since childhood is just an ordinary shrine[r]

There are some with bleached hair, but that natural golden hair must surely[r]

I haven't seen it myself, but considering she was strong enough to take down[r]

Considering what happened yesterday, should I call out to her?[pcms]

like a coward.[pcms]

*1844|
[fc]
I'm such a coward...[pcms]

*1845|
[fc]
Suddenly, I thought about my compatibility with Yuuho, not because Hiko-chin or[r]
Inori-san pointed it out.[pcms]

*1846|
[fc]
The reason Yuuho has never dated anyone is probably because our relationship was[r]
misunderstood, or simply because Yuuho is out of their league.[pcms]

*1847|
[fc]
If our relationship was just that of childhood friends and someone was really[r]
confident in themselves, they might want to pursue Yuuho, who is considered out[r]
of reach.[pcms]

*1848|
[fc]
Like... for example, someone like Oshima-senpai.[pcms]

*1849|
[fc]
By the way, he said we only exchanged email addresses, but I wonder what the[r]
real story is?[pcms]

*1850|
[fc]
Could he possibly come to the summer festival?[pcms]

*1851|
[fc]
And then, after learning from Yuuho that I'm just a childhood friend, he might[r]
confess on the spur of the moment...[pcms]

*1852|
[fc]
Oshima-senpai is the number one handsome guy at school after all.[pcms]

*1853|
[fc]
Yuuho probably wouldn't mind it either.[pcms]

*1854|
[fc]
I heard Oshima-senpai doesn't have a girlfriend right now.[pcms]

*1855|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"What should I do..."[pcms]

*1856|
[fc]
As I sank deeper into a swamp of thoughts, I finally reached home with heavy[r]
steps.[pcms]

"I'm home..."[pcms]

*1858|
[fc]
I muttered as I peeked into the empty living room before heading to my room.[pcms]

*1859|
[fc]
It's not like I have anything special to do for the festival, but I need to pack[r]
up the things I bought today and finish preparing for tomorrow's camp. I didn't[r]
want to see anyone.[pcms]

*1860|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Sigh..."[pcms]

*1861|
[fc]
As I sighed and was about to open my room's door, I noticed that Ren's door was[r]
half open.[pcms]

*1862|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Huh? Isn't everyone supposed to be out? Was it left open when they left?"[pcms]

*1863|
[fc]
I hope it's not that Ren's window was left open and a burglar got in?[pcms]

*1864|
[fc]
With that unlikely thought, I peeked into Ren's room.[pcms]

An unbelievable sight unfolded before my eyes.[pcms]

*1866|
[fc]
Ren was there.[pcms]

*1867|
[fc]
Well, it's Ren's room, so that's obvious, but... she's wearing a T-back.[pcms]

*1868|
[fc]
She seemed to be in the middle of changing into a yukata for the summer[r]
festival; I couldn't see everything.[pcms]

But even though she has a frail body due to congenital issues and poor[r]
development, the T-back that seemed unsuitable for her barely covered her[r]
crotch.[pcms]

*1870|
[fc]
Yet, as a girl of her age should be, there were beginnings of curves that a[r]
young girl wouldn't have around her butt and chest area.[pcms]

The T-back made her ass completely visible, and its perfect curve was almost[r]
inviting... making me want to touch it.[pcms]

When my gulp sounded unusually loud, Ren's scream shattered our frozen moment in[r]
time.[pcms]

I quickly apologized and closed Ren's door in a panic, then fled into my own[r]

Ren's butt seemed to be saying it wanted me to touch it?[pcms]

"I'm definitely not suited for Yuuho. Someone like Oshima-senpai would be much[r]

I let out a deep sigh and collapsed onto my bed. I threw the things I bought[r]
around and crawled under the covers without unpacking them.[pcms]

*1885|

I wish I could just stay buried here forever, deep down inside.[pcms]

*1886|

I knew it was impossible though.[pcms]
