Gakon![pcms]

*2193|
[fc]
As I struggled to close the hatch, I witnessed the sliding[r]
door being kicked open right before my eyes.[pcms]

*2194|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"This is bad. I need to escape quickly!!"[pcms]

*2195|
[fc]
I hurriedly finished closing the hatch and descended the[r]
ladder in a tumble.[pcms]

*2196|
[fc]
The ceiling was so low that I had to stoop to walk, and the[r]
only light was from the flashlight that the senior was[r]
holding.[pcms]

*2197|
[fc]
;The light coming in from the ventilation ducts was[r]
blinding, but it wasn't enough to fully illuminate the[r]
passageway, so I ran there relying on the light of the[r]
flashlight as if I was about to trip.[pcms]

*2198|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senior, the door has been broken!!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2199|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0278"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"I see. I didn't expect that door to hold anyway, it was[r]
anticipated. More importantly, let's open this hatch and get[r]
out."[pcms]

*2200|
[fc]
While saying that, the senior pointed with her flashlight to[r]
another hatch attached to the bare concrete foundation.[pcms]

*2201|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Man A[nse]
"I smell something good coming from here, huh?"[pcms]

*2202|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Person - Male B[nse]
"A woman... there's a woman here."[pcms]

*2203|
[fc]
Although it's hard to see in the dim light, I could finally[r]
make out a man's legs extending from the gaping hole.[pcms]

*2204|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"If we're opening this, why aren't you helping, Kousuke?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2205|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Why should I trust what a woman says?"[pcms]

*2206|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"What...!?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_d2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2207|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0179"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Kousuke has been acting like an idiot ever since earlier.[r]
Did something happen before you met up with me?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2208|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0319"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Nothing in particular, but Ko-chan has his own worries..."[pcms]

*2209|
[fc]
Although Ren defended him, which was contrary to Yuuho's[r]
rising anger, it's possible she learned something from[r]
Kousuke when they went to help Yuuho alone.[pcms]

*2210|
[fc]
Worries? What is he fussing about at a time like this?[r]
Kousuke...[pcms]

*2211|
[fc]
Is there something more important to him than his own life?[pcms]

*2212|
[fc]
I wanted to ask that, but for a moment, Yuuho's face flashed[r]
in my mind, and I wondered if Kousuke had someone in this[r]
school he would protect even at the cost of his own life.[pcms]

*2213|
[fc]
But Kousuke is friendly, though I've never heard him talk[r]
about having a crush on anyone at this school...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2214|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0279"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"We don't have time to dawdle. Let's just open it."[pcms]

*2215|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, yes."[pcms]

*2216|
[fc]
In a rush, I cooperated with the senior and we managed to[r]
open the hatch together.[pcms]

*2217|
[fc]
The darkness and my clumsy feet were a blessing; they hadn't[r]
fully descended yet, but they'll be here soon.[pcms]

*2218|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Alright... it's open. Yuuho, Ren, hurry down."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2219|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0320"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Okay."[pcms]

*2220|
[fc]
I pointed at the newly opened hatch and guided Yuuho and Ren[r]
towards it.[pcms]

*2221|
[fc]
The hole illuminated by the flashlight looked like it led[r]
straight to hell, gaping open.[pcms]

*2222|
[fc]
Since it wasn't a ladder like before but concrete stairs[r]
leading down, even Ren should be able to descend quickly.[pcms]

*2223|
[fc]
The hatch seemed to close on its own if let go; the senior[r]
supported the lid until Yuuho and Ren descended in that[r]
order.[pcms]

*2224|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senior, please go down first. I'll support it now."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2225|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0280"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Is that so? Then..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2226|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Where does this lead to?"[pcms]

*2227|
[fc]
Just as I was about to take over supporting the hatch lid[r]
from the senior, Kousuke's voice echoed through the[r]
passageway.[pcms]

*2228|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Where does it lead... In our current situation, is that[r]
really what you're worried about?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f10"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2229|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Hey hey! It's exactly because of times like this that we[r]
need to worry about that. Are you seriously going down this[r]
hole? We might get trapped!"[pcms]

*2230|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Do you think we're in a position to complain? Just jump in[r]
already."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2231|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Wait, Wataru"[pcms]

;//キャラ消し
[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*2232|
[fc]
After making sure Ren had descended far enough, I pushed[r]
Kousuke into the hole as if shoving him down.[pcms]

*2233|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senior, quickly."[pcms]

*2234|
[fc]
After swapping with the senior who was supporting the hatch,[r]
I urged her to jump down first, and without any hesitation[r]
or wasted words, she dove into the hole.[pcms]

*2235|
[fc]
Following her lead, I also jumped into the hole.[pcms]

*2236|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Man A[nse]
"I'll rape the women and eat the men!!!!!"[pcms]

*2237|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Man B[nse]
"I'm starving."[pcms]

*2238|
[fc]
The voices of the infected were getting much closer. Had[r]
they already descended the ladder?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2239|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0281"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"I'm closing it."[pcms]

*2240|
[fc]
With a short command from the senior and as if cutting off[r]
the voices of the men chasing us, I heard the heavy sound of[r]
the hatch closing.[pcms]

*2241|
[fc]
Did we make it out safely?[pcms]

;//〆：黒画面
;[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=1000][hide_chara_int]

*2242|
[fc]
The sound of the senior locking the hatch resonated heavily[r]
in my ears.[pcms]
