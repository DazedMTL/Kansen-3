And then, for a while, the two of us remained silent.[pcms]

*3459|
[fc]
As a heavy silence began to flow between me and Jin, an ugly voice I didn't want[r]
to hear echoed from afar.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3460|

[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"Aniki! Some people are coming up!"[pcms]

*3461|
[fc]
Shige, who rushed into the room in a panic, shouted to Jin while repeatedly[r]
checking the corridor behind the door.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3462|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Close the door. Let's wait and see."[pcms]

*3463|
[fc]
Jin pushed me away and headed towards the door where Shige stood, gave him some[r]
instructions, and then both of them crouched down on either side of the door.[pcms]

*3464|
[fc]
Both of them aimed their guns at the same time.[pcms]

*3465|
[fc]
The quiet space was enveloped in tension, as if frozen by the cold atmosphere[r]
unique to Jin and the guns they held.[pcms]

*3466|
[fc]
I couldn't do anything but hide in the shadow of a bookshelf, staring only at[r]
the door.[pcms]

[vo_miz s="mizuki0142"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Hik..."[pcms]

*3468|
[fc]
The only sound that resonated in the silent space was that of the doorknob being[r]
turned.[pcms]

*3469|
[fc]
At that sound, Shige tried to stand up, but I could see Jin stopping him.[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_e4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3470|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki0143"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*3471|
[fc]
Jin, Shige, and I, none of us made a sound; only the noise of the doorknob[r]
turning filled the room.[pcms]

*3472|
[fc]
[ns]？？？[nse]
"...It won't open. Is it locked?"[pcms]
;//＠浩助

*3473|
[fc]
A familiar voice...? But who?[pcms]

*3474|
[fc]
I could hear someone talking in the corridor beyond the door.[pcms]

*3475|
[fc]
Reacting to that voice, Shige looked at Jin with his gun shaking, waiting for[r]
instructions.[pcms]

*3476|
[fc]
Jin shook his head slightly and then looked back at the door.[pcms]

"!!"[pcms]

[vo_mar s="maru1276"]
[ns]？？？[nse]
"Is... is there no one there?"[pcms]
;//＠製品時に？？？に置換

*3479|
[fc]
I was becoming unable to bear the tension of the moment and almost responded[r]
reflexively.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3480|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*3481|
[fc]
Noticing that, Jin glared at me.[pcms]

*3482|
[fc]
Somehow holding back my voice, I turned my gaze and ears back to the door, where[r]
I could hear voices talking outside, followed by footsteps receding.[pcms]

*3483|
[fc]
After a while, Jin pressed his ear against the door to check outside, then[r]
suddenly stood up and walked towards me.[pcms]

*3484|
[fc]
Following him like a shadow was Shige.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3485|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Voices of a woman and a kid... But they managed to get in despite the lock. Who[r]
are they?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3486|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"That voice... it's the blonde woman's voice."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3487|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Blonde...? Ah, 'that one'."[pcms]

*3488|
[fc]
Shige's expression was trembling with anger as he mentioned the blonde woman.[pcms]

*3489|
[fc]
I also remembered something upon hearing Shige's words. On the first floor here,[r]
Shige had been kicked down by a blonde woman.[pcms]

*3490|
[fc]
And... she was supposed to be with Kousuke and the others.[pcms]

*3491|
[fc]
I couldn't hear well because of the door, but could that familiar voice possibly[r]
be Kousuke?[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_e4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3492|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki0145"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Kousuke..."[pcms]

*3493|
[fc]
If I were to think optimistically, Kousuke would be safe... and also nearby.[pcms]

*3494|
[fc]
I wanted to open the door and chase after him right away.[pcms]

*3495|
[fc]
But Jin was here.[pcms]

*3496|
[fc]
I should stay put for now...[pcms]
