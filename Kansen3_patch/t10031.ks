"...Let's see."[pcms]

*5572|
[fc]
Inside the large analog record shop on the 4th floor, "Recomani," everyone[r]
scattered to their own favorite corners.[pcms]

*5573|
[fc]
This record shop boasts the largest floor space and inventory in Japan.[pcms]

*5574|
[fc]
In Udagawacho, as the shops in Reco Village one by one became mail-order only[r]
and closed down, this store remained incredibly valuable to those who are[r]
particular about black vinyl (analog records)... or so Kousuke says.[pcms]

*5575|
[fc]
They also sell used CDs and DVDs, so it's not just for those looking for rare[r]
records. Even someone like me has been taken care of here occasionally.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_c11"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5576|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*5577|
[fc]
As expected, Kousuke was in the analog record corner, swiftly flipping through[r]
the records on the shelves with nimble fingers.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5578|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki_T0002"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Kousuke, you look so serious. It's just us here, you don't have to check[r]
everything so frantically, do you?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_c2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5579|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"No, I know, but... somehow, I don't feel like I'm DIGging unless I do this..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5580|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki_T0003"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"You really love digging for music sources, huh?"[pcms]

*5581|
[fc]
I thought that since no one else would be shopping, they could come back and[r]
look as many times as they wanted... but I decided not to interrupt the two who[r]
seemed to be getting along so well and headed to another corner.[pcms]

*5582|
[fc]
Seeing the two of them so friendly with each other, I didn't want to disturb[r]
them, so I turned my feet towards another corner.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5583|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*5584|
[fc]
In the used DVD corner, Jin-san stood with his arms crossed, searching through[r]
the DVD-BOX sets with a serious expression.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5585|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0006"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"White House Twenty Four? Jin-san, you're interested in that kind of thing?"[pcms]

*5586|
[fc]
Yuuho raised her voice in surprise as she followed Jin-san's gaze. He was[r]
looking at a foreign drama series that had won numerous awards.[pcms]

*5587|
[fc]
I was a bit surprised myself. I thought that Jin-san and his rough companions[r]
would only watch yakuza movies.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5588|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Uh, well... yeah. But the TV in the 7th-floor dressing room is small. It lacks[r]
impact..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5589|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki_T0004"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Then why not watch it in the 5th-floor theater room? The screen is big, and[r]
there are headphones. There are even reclining seats with massage functions."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5590|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Massage... they have such things?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5591|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki_T0005"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Jin, you get stiff shoulders easily, right? It might be nice for you. You might[r]
feel so good that you fall asleep."[pcms]

*5592|
[fc]
Mizuki passed by with a laugh, teasing Jin-san.[pcms]

*5593|
[fc]
Well... I should also pick up a CD or something. Last month, my favorite artist[r]
released a best-of album. I hope it's already in the used section...[pcms]

*5594|
[fc]
As I looked around, I found quite a few CDs I wanted to listen to and ended up[r]
with my hands full of cases.[pcms]

*5595|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Hmm. I can't laugh at Kousuke now."[pcms]

*5596|
[fc]
Carefully walking so as not to drop the CD cases, I came across Yuuho and Ren[r]
emerging from between the shelves.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5597|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0007"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Ren-chan, have you decided what you want?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_a8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5598|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren_T0007"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yeah, I found a masterpiece conducted by Anselmo, so I think I'll listen to it[r]
later."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5599|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0008"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I've also picked up quite a bit, but now..."[pcms]

*5600|
[fc]
The two stopped in front of the anti-theft security gates set up at the exit.[pcms]

*5601|
[fc]
The floor had electricity running through it, so presumably, this security[r]
system was also active.[pcms]

*5602|
[fc]
We wouldn't have security or staff come running even if the buzzer went off, but[r]
still, being blasted with a loud warning isn't good for the heart.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5603|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0009"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"The question is how we get past this, right?"[pcms]

;//＠防犯装置の前で迷っている

*5604|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai passed by Yuuho with an innocent face as she pondered.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5605|

[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0010"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Wait, Maruko-senpai!?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5607|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru_T0009"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Hm?"[pcms]

*5608|
[fc]
Yuuho called out in a hurry, but the senior had already passed through the gate.[pcms]

*5609|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That... just now... the alarm didn't go off, did it?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5610|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru_T0010"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Ah, the anti-theft tag? There was a device at the register so I took it off."[pcms]

*5611|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai nonchalantly stated while holding a box set of Showa-era[r]
melodramas in both arms.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5612|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren_T0008"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I see, so that's why it didn't go off."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5613|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0011"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Shall we go remove ours too?"[pcms]

*5614|
[fc]
We headed to the register and removed the magnetic tags from the CDs we had[r]
chosen.[pcms]

*5615|
[fc]
We also borrowed some paper bags to consolidate our items.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_a4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5616|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren_T0009"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Even knowing it won't go off, it still makes me nervous..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5617|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0012"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Yeah. It feels like we're doing something bad..."[pcms]

*5618|
[fc]
The two shared a mischievous smile and laughed as they passed through the gate.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5618a|
[fc]
About to leave the store myself, I looked up and noticed an escalator on the[r]
opposite side of the elevator entrance.[pcms]

*5619|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Now that I think about it... there was this too."[pcms]

*5620|
[fc]
I don't usually stop by the store on the 3rd floor, but I have taken the[r]
escalator up to the music store on the 2nd floor.[pcms]

*5621|
[fc]
As I approached, the escalator's lights were turned off, and it seemed to be out[r]
of operation.[pcms]

*5622|
[fc]
There were two areas for boarding, one for going up and one for going down. The[r]
one for going up had a sign and a rope at the entrance, and it seemed like it[r]
was originally not meant to be used.[pcms]

*5623|
[fc]
But I didn't see any escalators in "GyuuGyuu Heaven" on the 6th floor or[r]
"Arcadia" on the 5th floor...[pcms]

*5624|
[fc]
Setting aside the one going down, I wonder how far up the escalator for[r]
ascending goes?[pcms]
