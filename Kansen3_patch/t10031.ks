"...Let's see."[pcms]

*5572|
[fc]
Inside the large analog record shop on the 4th floor,[r]
"Recomani," everyone scattered to their own favorite[r]
corners.[pcms]

*5573|
[fc]
This record shop boasts the largest floor space and[r]
inventory in Japan.[pcms]

*5574|
[fc]
In Udagawacho, as the shops in Reco Village one by one[r]
became mail-order only and closed down, this store remained[r]
incredibly valuable to those who are particular about black[r]
vinyl (analog records)... or so Kousuke says.[pcms]

*5575|
[fc]
They also sell used CDs and DVDs, so it's not just for those[r]
looking for rare records. Even someone like me has been[r]
taken care of here occasionally.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_c11"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5576|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*5577|
[fc]
As expected, Kousuke was in the analog record corner,[r]
swiftly flipping through the records on the shelves with[r]
nimble fingers.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5578|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki_T0002"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Kousuke, you look so serious. It's just us here, you don't[r]
have to check everything so frantically, do you?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_c2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5579|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"No, I know, but... somehow, I don't feel like I'm DIGging[r]
unless I do this..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5580|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki_T0003"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"You really love digging for music sources, huh?"[pcms]

*5581|
[fc]
I thought that since no one else would be shopping, they[r]
could come back and look as many times as they wanted... but[r]
I decided not to interrupt the two who seemed to be getting[r]
along so well and headed to another corner.[pcms]

*5582|
[fc]
Seeing the two of them so friendly with each other, I didn't[r]
want to disturb them, so I turned my feet towards another[r]
corner.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5583|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*5584|
[fc]
In the used DVD corner, Jin-san stood with his arms crossed,[r]
searching through the DVD-BOX sets with a serious[r]
expression.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5585|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0006"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"White House Twenty Four? Jin-san, you're interested in that[r]
kind of thing?"[pcms]

*5586|
[fc]
Yuuho raised her voice in surprise as she followed Jin-san's[r]
gaze. He was looking at a foreign drama series that had won[r]
numerous awards.[pcms]

*5587|
[fc]
I was a bit surprised myself. I thought that Jin-san and his[r]
rough companions would only watch yakuza movies.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5588|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Uh, well... yeah. But the TV in the 7th-floor dressing room[r]
is small. It lacks impact..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5589|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki_T0004"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Then why not watch it in the 5th-floor theater room? The[r]
screen is big, and there are headphones. There are even[r]
reclining seats with massage functions."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5590|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Massage... they have such things?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5591|
[fc]
[vo_miz s="mizuki_T0005"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Jin, you get stiff shoulders easily, right? It might be[r]
nice for you. You might feel so good that you fall asleep."[pcms]

*5592|
[fc]
Mizuki passed by with a laugh, teasing Jin-san.[pcms]

*5593|
[fc]
Well... I should also pick up a CD or something. Last month,[r]
my favorite artist released a best-of album. I hope it's[r]
already in the used section...[pcms]

*5594|
[fc]
As I looked around, I found quite a few CDs I wanted to[r]
listen to and ended up with my hands full of cases.[pcms]

*5595|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Hmm. I can't laugh at Kousuke now."[pcms]

*5596|
[fc]
Carefully walking so as not to drop the CD cases, I came[r]
across Yuuho and Ren emerging from between the shelves.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5597|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0007"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Ren-chan, have you decided what you want?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_a8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5598|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren_T0007"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yeah, I found a masterpiece conducted by Anselmo, so I[r]
think I'll listen to it later."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5599|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0008"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I've also picked up quite a bit, but now..."[pcms]

*5600|
[fc]
The two stopped in front of the anti-theft security gates[r]
set up at the exit.[pcms]

*5601|
[fc]
The floor had electricity running through it, so presumably,[r]
this security system was also active.[pcms]

*5602|
[fc]
We wouldn't have security or staff come running even if the[r]
buzzer went off, but still, being blasted with a loud[r]
warning isn't good for the heart.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5603|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0009"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"The question is how we get past this, right?"[pcms]

;//＠防犯装置の前で迷っている

*5604|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai passed by Yuuho with an innocent face as she[r]
pondered.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0010"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Wait, Maruko-senpai!?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5607|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru_T0009"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Hm?"[pcms]

*5608|
[fc]
Yuuho called out in a hurry, but the senior had already[r]
passed through the gate.[pcms]

*5609|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That... just now... the alarm didn't go off, did it?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5610|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru_T0010"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Ah, the anti-theft tag? There was a device at the register[r]
so I took it off."[pcms]

*5611|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai nonchalantly stated while holding a box set of[r]
Showa-era melodramas in both arms.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5612|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren_T0008"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I see, so that's why it didn't go off."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5613|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0011"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Shall we go remove ours too?"[pcms]

*5614|
[fc]
We headed to the register and removed the magnetic tags from[r]
the CDs we had chosen.[pcms]

*5615|
[fc]
We also borrowed some paper bags to consolidate our items.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_a4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5616|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren_T0009"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Even knowing it won't go off, it still makes me nervous..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*5617|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho_T0012"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Yeah. It feels like we're doing something bad..."[pcms]

*5618|
[fc]
The two shared a mischievous smile and laughed as they[r]
passed through the gate.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*5618a|
[fc]
About to leave the store myself, I looked up and noticed an[r]
escalator on the opposite side of the elevator entrance.[pcms]

*5619|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Now that I think about it... there was this too."[pcms]

*5620|
[fc]
I don't usually stop by the store on the 3rd floor, but I[r]
have taken the escalator up to the music store on the 2nd[r]
floor.[pcms]

*5621|
[fc]
As I approached, the escalator's lights were turned off, and[r]
it seemed to be out of operation.[pcms]

*5622|
[fc]
There were two areas for boarding, one for going up and one[r]
for going down. The one for going up had a sign and a rope[r]
at the entrance, and it seemed like it was originally not[r]
meant to be used.[pcms]

*5623|
[fc]
But I didn't see any escalators in "GyuuGyuu Heaven" on the[r]
6th floor or "Arcadia" on the 5th floor...[pcms]

*5624|
[fc]
Setting aside the one going down, I wonder how far up the[r]
escalator for ascending goes?[pcms]
