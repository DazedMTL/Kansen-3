"Good morning. I would like to start the emergency strategy meeting[r]
immediately."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"There's no need to start at such an early hour..."[pcms]

*3|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"We're not exactly free either."[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_mob s="josei0002"]
[ns]Female[nse]
"I apologize for calling you early in the morning. However, the situation is[r]
more serious than you all may think."[pcms]

*5|
[fc]
[ns]Participant C[nse]
"For something so serious, we haven't received much information beforehand, have[r]
we?"[pcms]

*6|
[fc]
[vo_mob s="josei0003"]
[ns]Female[nse]
"That's precisely why I'm saying it's serious. Please understand that."[pcms]

*7|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"Does that mean it's something that can't be leaked to the outside?"[pcms]

*8|
[fc]
[vo_mob s="josei0004"]
[ns]Female[nse]
"You may interpret it that way without any problems."[pcms]

*9|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"Hmm..."[pcms]

*10|
[fc]
As if that single word was a signal, the atmosphere in the room became tense.[pcms]

*11|
[fc]
[vo_mob s="josei0005"]
[ns]Female[nse]
"Now, please take a look at this first."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Participant C[nse]
"As I thought..."[pcms]

*13|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"It's this again..."[pcms]

*14|
[fc]
The dark conference room's screen displayed an overview of "UNKNOWN-LV4."[pcms]

*15|
[fc]
And in front of that screen stood a man dressed in a suit.[pcms]

*16|
[fc]
The man introduced by the woman as "Dr. Noguchi" stood with a grave expression,[r]
staring at the screen.[pcms]

*17|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"We don't have much time, so I'll briefly explain the overview and then move on[r]
to the main topic."[pcms]

*18|
[fc]
Waving a pointer, Dr. Noguchi quickly began to explain the virus's[r]
characteristics, development history, and the disaster's outbreak to containment[r]
in the Tohoku region.[pcms]

*19|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"That concludes the current situation and overview of this virus."[pcms]

[evcg storage="evs007b"][trans_c cross time=300]

*20|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Now, please look at the schematic diagram displayed here next."[pcms]

*21|
[fc]
The new image projected on the screen was one of the variants of "UNKNOWN-LV4."[pcms]

*22|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"This photo shows a form very similar to "UNKNOWN-LV4," but it is one of the[r]
variants."[pcms]

*23|
[fc]
[ns]Participant C[nse]
"Do viruses change so easily?"[pcms]

*24|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"In nature, it's a common phenomenon. Simpler life forms evolve more quickly..."[pcms]

*25|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"And what about this mutated virus?"[pcms]

*26|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Yes... Mutation itself is not a special case, similar to influenza."[pcms]

*27|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"This variant in the photo was collected from several male patients who were[r]
arrested last night at Jingu Gaien."[pcms]

*28|
[fc]
The previously silent conference room erupted into noise at those words, as if[r]
someone had coughed.[pcms]

*29|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"...Moreover, this virus was found in large quantities in their blood."[pcms]

*30|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"So you mean..."[pcms]

*31|
[fc]
[ns]Participant C[nse]
"A new type of infection is spreading?"[pcms]

*32|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"...Unfortunately, it seems so."[pcms]

*33|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"It seems so isn't good enough! We need to act quickly..."[pcms]

*34|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"That's why we've gathered here early in the morning, to take swift action."[pcms]

*35|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*36|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"Then what's the scale of the infection?"[pcms]

*37|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"The currently identified infected are victims of consecutive falling accidents[r]
at Yoyogi Station, Jingu Gaien Station, and inside various stations in Tokyo."[pcms]

*38|
[fc]
[ns]Participant C[nse]
"Does that mean it's already spreading within Tokyo?!"[pcms]

*39|
[fc]
The solemn atmosphere of the meeting was gone. The surroundings buzzed like a[r]
gambling den, with some even starting to make calls on their cell phones.[pcms]

*40|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"But Dr., LV4 was said to be completely contained according to earlier[r]
explanations, and adequate measures were taken afterward, weren't they?"[pcms]

*41|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Yes... At least that was supposed to be the case."[pcms]

*42|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"Then why has it come to this situation?!"[pcms]

*43|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"At this point, it's still unclear and within the realm of speculation..."[pcms]

*44|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"Let us hear your speculations then."[pcms]

*45|
[fc]
Dr. Noguchi, cornered, looked towards a high-ranking bureaucrat as if seeking[r]
help.[pcms]

*46|
[fc]
The bureaucrat, who had been silently standing in a corner of the conference[r]
room, quietly nodded back.[pcms]

*47|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Well... that is... In fact, some of the infected were captured with the[r]
cooperation of the United States military..."[pcms]

*48|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"And they were being studied at a quarantine facility we built on the old[r]
Funakoshi Peninsula with the United States."[pcms]

*49|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"However... activists from radical human rights and environmental protection[r]
groups, along with freelance journalists, infiltrated the facility with an[r]
insider's help..."[pcms]

*50|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"They interfered with security during their intrusion, which resulted in a[r]
serious accident inside..."[pcms]

*51|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"The facility was destroyed by the emergency auto-purification system, but[r]
during the chaos, one vehicle broke through the blockade..."[pcms]

*52|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"That vehicle was later found near Kesennuma, and the driver's body was[r]
discovered."[pcms]

*53|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"The cause of death was excessive bleeding from gunshot wounds, but there were[r]
signs that someone else had been in the car..."[pcms]

*54|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"Get to the point, the conclusion!!"[pcms]

*55|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Yes, in short... It is believed that an infected person who was being[r]
quarantined was in that vehicle."[pcms]

*56|
[fc]
[ns]Participant C[nse]
"So someone took an infected person out of the facility and released them into[r]
the wild..."[pcms]

*57|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Whether it was intentional or not, that seems to be the likely possibility."[pcms]

*58|
[fc]
The conference room erupted into a storm once again over the concealment of a[r]
matter of national security.[pcms]

*59|
[fc]
Both the doctor and the bureaucrat watched the commotion as if it were someone[r]
else's problem, merely clicking their tongues.[pcms]

*60|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"However, the new strain of virus discovered this time is, as of now, a variant[r]
that we were studying at the facility and for which no cure has been found..."[pcms]

*61|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"So you're saying there's no vaccine to save those infected with this most[r]
dangerous type?"[pcms]

*62|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"That... That would be the case..."[pcms]

*63|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Even the latest vaccines developed domestically through breeding of those[r]
provided by the United States during the infection disaster can only prevent[r]
airborne transmission at best."[pcms]

*64|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Furthermore, their effectiveness as antiviral drugs is limited, and if taken[r]
continuously, there's a high possibility that the virus will acquire[r]
resistance..."[pcms]

*65|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"So long-term use of antiviral drugs would become ineffective, is that it?"[pcms]

*66|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"We have no choice but to consider a large-scale response, including declaring a[r]
state of emergency urgently..."[pcms]

*67|
[fc]
[ns]Participant C[nse]
"It's easy to say 'consider,' but this disaster is happening in the capital!"[pcms]

*68|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"Do you think we can handle this like some regional city?"[pcms]

*69|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"If we respond as we did before, the capital's functions will completely[r]
collapse..."[pcms]

*70|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"Without a doubt, our country will suffer an economic blow from which recovery[r]
may not be possible."[pcms]

*71|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"But if we just sit on our hands, think of how many lives will be..."[pcms]

*72|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"You're the ones who kept such a dangerous thing hidden!"[pcms]

*73|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*74|
[fc]
Dr. Noguchi understood the severity of the situation and the terror of the virus[r]
better than anyone else, but he had no room to argue against that statement.[pcms]

*75|
[fc]
The participants' cell phones rang incessantly one after another.[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=1000][hide_chara_int]

*76|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"Anyway, this is not a situation that can be resolved with immediate decisions[r]
at this point."[pcms]

*77|
[fc]
[ns]Participant B[nse]
"Indeed. First, we need to consult with various parties..."[pcms]

*78|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"We don't have that kind of time! The infection is spreading even now..."[pcms]

*79|
[fc]
[ns]Participant C[nse]
"For now, let's compile a response plan within our agencies and discuss again[r]
tomorrow."[pcms]

*80|
[fc]
[ns]Participant A[nse]
"Thank you for your efforts, Dr. Noguchi."[pcms]

*81|
[fc]
The doctor was unilaterally cut off from the meeting, with no opportunity to[r]
persist.[pcms]

*82|
[fc]
Dr. Noguchi took out his cell phone and stared blankly at its display...[pcms]

*83|
[fc]
[ns]Noguchi[nse]
"Tomorrow... I hope that tomorrow comes..."[pcms]

*84|
[fc]
He muttered quietly to himself.[pcms]
