"Hmm, hmm hmm hmm~"[pcms]

*1140|
[fc]
I hummed to myself as I drained the boiled somen noodles[r]
into a colander and rinsed off the sliminess with running[r]
water.[pcms]

*1141|
[fc]
Even after setting aside a portion for Dad, it feels like[r]
there's too much for just Ren and me... Well, we'll manage[r]
to eat it all somehow.[pcms]

*1142|
[fc]
If I add canned fruits like oranges and pineapples, which[r]
also serve as dessert, it somehow looks more luxurious.[pcms]

*1143|
[fc]
As I nodded to myself alone in the kitchen, Dad appeared[r]
with his finished dishes in hand.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan2"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1144|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Thanks for the meal~. Wait, why do you guys get fruit?"[pcms]

*1145|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Didn't you say last time that you didn't like the somen[r]
getting sweet if fruit was added? Something about it being[r]
more appropriate for cold buckwheat noodles."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1146|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"...You could have just served it on a separate plate,[r]
right?"[pcms]

*1147|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That would just increase the dishes to wash. Ah, leave that[r]
there by the sink."[pcms]

*1148|
[fc]
With a tone of envy and a bit of a sulk, Dad looked at the[r]
fruit floating in the bowl as I coldly responded and started[r]
to prepare the condiments for the noodle dipping sauce.[pcms]

*1149|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"I heard from Ren that we were having curry today. Why[r]
somen? It's fine for lunch, but somen for dinner doesn't sit[r]
well with me."[pcms]

*1150|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Can't be helped, right? Ren came down with a fever."[pcms]

*1151|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"You boasted to Ren that you could make curry, didn't you?"[pcms]

*1152|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Of course I can make curry. But I thought it might be bad[r]
for Ren's throat if her fever wasn't from walking around in[r]
the daytime but from a cold."[pcms]

*1153|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Oh come on, are you making excuses? ...Well, it's true that[r]
Ren is your top priority. It wouldn't hurt to pay a little[r]
attention to your dad too."[pcms]

*1154|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"While you say that, you're about to head off to work,[r]
right? Where's the time to care for a workaholic?"[pcms]

*1155|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Ugh, mmm...you hit where it hurts! I'll do tomorrow's tape[r]
check at the company."[pcms]

*1156|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I've already set up the recording for the fireworks[r]
broadcast, and besides, taking tapes out of the company[r]
other than rentals is prohibited."[pcms]

*1157|
[fc]
As I took out concentrated noodle sauce and cold water from[r]
the fridge without looking at Dad, I replied.[pcms]

*1158|
[fc]
Dad is in charge of broadcasting the Oedo Fireworks Festival[r]
every year, and even without that event, he works at DHK, so[r]
it's usual for him to head straight to work when there's a[r]
big incident.[pcms]

*1159|
[fc]
Calling him a workaholic might be right in a way.[pcms]

*1160|
[fc]
I'm somewhat envious of my father who can say he loves his[r]
job.[pcms]

*1161|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"By the way, wasn't there a documentary you worked on[r]
recently?"[pcms]

*1162|
[fc]
I glared at Dad and after a beat...[pcms]

*1163|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Parents Who Neglect Meals with Their Children! The Light[r]
and Shadow of Modern Japan!!"[pcms]

*1164|
[fc]
I wasn't jealous of my father for having the job he wanted,[r]
but I deliberately teased him by quoting the subtitle of a[r]
documentary I had seen before.[pcms]

*1165|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Eh? Oh, ahaha..."[pcms]

*1166|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"The cobbler's children have no shoes, a doctor who neglects[r]
his own health, darkness under the lighthouse!!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1167|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Whoa, I'll borrow the Space Journey DVD for you next time,[r]
so please forgive me!!"[pcms]

*1168|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Boo~! I already have it."[pcms]

*1169|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Oh..."[pcms]

*1170|
[fc]
In an attempt to dodge my barrage of attacks, Dad's eyes[r]
shone triumphantly as he realized I already had the DVD[r]
title he blurted out.[pcms]

*1171|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"But what about the Director's Cut edition that just started[r]
reservations? You're saying you have that one, Wataru-dono?"[pcms]

*1172|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? The Director's Cut edition... that includes unreleased[r]
footage scheduled for sale in autumn?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan2"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1173|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Hehehe... Listen well, Echigoya. It's just re-editing the[r]
content."[pcms]

*1174|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"The master is already finished; we're just waiting on the[r]
package design now. But you wouldn't want to see it, would[r]
you?"[pcms]

*1175|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wowww, my lord~!"[pcms]

*1176|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Humph! Have you realized the power of a father yet?!"[pcms]

*1177|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Haha, my apologies~"[pcms]

*1178|
[fc]
While bowing my head like a corrupt magistrate before an[r]
all-powerful badge, my hands continued to work tirelessly[r]
adjusting the concentrated noodle sauce to make the dipping[r]
broth for the somen.[pcms]

*1179|
[fc]
As I poured it into bowls, I glanced at the clock in the[r]
kitchen.[pcms]

*1180|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Speaking of which, isn't it about time?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1181|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Oh right. I'm heading out now. It shouldn't be too late...[r]
Take care of Ren for me."[pcms]

*1182|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Roger that. Good luck with work, Dad."[pcms]

*1183|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Yeah. I'll show you a fireworks festival that's better than[r]
seeing it live."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*1184|
[fc]
After seeing Dad off with a grin as he left the living room,[r]
I placed the somen and dipping sauce on a tray and headed[r]
towards Ren's room.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren, I've brought dinner. Can I come in?"[pcms]

*1186|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0035"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Big brother? Just a moment..."[pcms]

*1187|
[fc]
When I knocked and called out to Ren who should be inside[r]
her room, she replied with an unusually flustered voice.[pcms]

*1188|
[fc]
Along with that came sounds of something being hastily put[r]
away.[pcms]

*1189|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm coming in."[pcms]

[evcg storage="EV010a"][trans_c cross time=300]

*1190|
[fc]
After saying a word, I opened the door and saw Ren, who was[r]
at least quietly lying in bed under a towelket.[pcms]

*1191|
[fc]
Her complexion seemed a bit better than in the evening, but[r]
her cheeks still looked faintly red.[pcms]

*1192|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0036"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Geez. You didn't even wait for me to say it's okay before[r]
you just came in."[pcms]

*1193|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"You were supposed to be resting, but you were just[r]
hurriedly hiding the manga you were reading in secret,[r]
weren't you?"[pcms]

*1194|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0037"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Uh..."[pcms]

*1195|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ahaha. That kind of reaction really does remind me of Dad."[pcms]

*1196|
[fc]
I laughed as I placed the tray beside the bed and peered[r]
into Ren's face.[pcms]

*1197|
[fc]
Her purple eyes, usually hidden behind light-blocking[r]
colored contact lenses to avoid strange looks due to her[r]
light sensitivity, stared back at me.[pcms]

*1198|
[fc]
In novels and comics, they might be described as violet or[r]
amethyst, but the color of Ren's eyes is so striking that[r]
you wouldn't understand unless you saw them yourself.[pcms]

*1199|
[fc]
No matter how many times I see them, I never get used to[r]
them.[pcms]

*1200|
[fc]
Even a poet who could instantly come up with a million[r]
eloquent phrases would only think of the trite word[r]
"beautiful."[pcms]

*1201|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0038"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Sorry for making you prepare dinner, big brother. I took[r]
advantage today, but it's not like it's unusual for me to[r]
get a fever. You're overreacting."[pcms]

*1202|
[fc]
Her eyes still seemed a bit moist as if she hadn't fully[r]
recovered from the fever, and looking up at me like that[r]
stirred my protective instincts, though I smiled to hide it.[pcms]

*1203|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"If we take 'usual' for granted and it turns out to be a[r]
serious illness, that would be bad, right? Early detection[r]
and treatment are key for anything."[pcms]

*1204|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0039"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"But... I don't smell curry. Wasn't dinner supposed to be[r]
curry? It's not like I have a cold; curry would have been[r]
fine."[pcms]

*1205|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Huh? I said I could make curry, but think about it, I'm[r]
going camping with the club the day after tomorrow, right?"[pcms]

*1206|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0040"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yeah."[pcms]

*1207|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"The menu for that is curry. If we have curry today, it'll[r]
inevitably be curry tomorrow too."[pcms]

*1208|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Three days of curry in a row is a bit much... That's why I[r]
went with somen. It's simple."[pcms]

*1209|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0041"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Ehh, wasn't it because you were considering my feelings?[r]
That's mean, big brother."[pcms]

*1210|
[fc]
I laughed as I stopped Ren from getting out of bed in a huff[r]
and re-covered her with the towelket that had slipped off[r]
her shoulders.[pcms]

*1211|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ahaha. You know I'm just kidding, right? Hey, how's your[r]
fever? Has it gone down?"[pcms]

*1212|
[fc]
As I touched my forehead to hers to check her temperature,[r]
despite her moist eyes, Ren's fever had completely subsided.[pcms]

*1213|
[fc]
I brushed away the hair that had come loose and was[r]
entangling her face as I pulled away from her forehead.[pcms]

[evcg storage="EV010b"][trans_c cross time=300]

*1214|
[fc]
My cheeks relaxed in relief, and seeing that, Ren also[r]
smiled.[pcms]

*1215|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Hmm, you should be able to get up and eat now."[pcms]

*1216|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0042"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"That's why I said you worry too much..."[pcms]

*1217|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"If worrying is all it takes to keep you healthy, then I'll[r]
worry as much as it takes, right?"[pcms]

*1218|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Dad said he wouldn't be late tonight, but since he's not[r]
here..."[pcms]

*1219|
[fc]
I smiled at Ren who was still a bit sulky and was about to[r]
leave her room.[pcms]

*1220|
[fc]
Then--[pcms]

;//<ImageLoad 4,EV008a.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1221|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0043"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"If Dad's out, where are you going to eat, big brother?"[pcms]

*1222|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Where else... probably my room."[pcms]

*1223|
[fc]
I answered Ren's question without much thought.[pcms]

*1224|
[fc]
Eating in the living room would be easier when considering[r]
cleanup, but eventually, I'd have to go down anyway to take[r]
care of Ren's finished dishes.[pcms]

*1225|
[fc]
Eating in my own room might actually be more convenient...[pcms]

*1226|
[fc]
I realized this only after answering her question[r]
unconsciously.[pcms]

;//<ImageLoad 4,EV008b.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1227|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0044"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Then... I want to eat with you, big brother."[pcms]

*1228|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Right. Your fever's gone down too, and eating alone is[r]
bland. Sure."[pcms]

;//<ImageLoad 4,EV008a.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1229|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0045"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"But what about your portion?"[pcms]

*1230|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Oh, mine's still in the kitchen. It'll get cold, so start[r]
eating in my room first."[pcms]

;//<ImageLoad 4,EV008b.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1231|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0046"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Okay. Got it."[pcms]

*1232|
[fc]
I left Ren smiling sweetly as she answered and headed to the[r]
kitchen to get my share.[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=1000][hide_chara_int]

*1233|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Oops..."[pcms]

*1234|
[fc]
As I returned to my room with my set of somen, Ren had just[r]
arrived and was placing her somen on a small table on a[r]
tray.[pcms]

*1235|
[fc]
But then again, Ren was only wearing a pair of panties and[r]
an oversized black T-shirt--[pcms]

*1236|
[fc]
The moment I opened the door, Ren's panties were in full[r]
view.[pcms]

*1237|
[fc]
I wondered if it was really okay for a girl her age to come[r]
over in such a slightly erotic outfit, even if it was her[r]
brother's room.[pcms]

*1238|
[fc]
Well, she must see me not as a man but simply as her[r]
brother, innocently adoring me like when she was a child.[pcms]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Yeah..."[pcms]

While I found Ren's fidgety behavior a bit strange, I placed[r]
my portion opposite her and sat down across the small table.[pcms]

*1245|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"It's been a while, so the ice has started to melt. I[r]
brought some more, do you need it?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="ren_d8"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Yeah... I'll take some."[pcms]

*1247|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Hmm... I put too much water, after all. It's causing[r]
surface tension."[pcms]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"Right... Dad's already left, hasn't he?"[pcms]

*1249|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah. He ate dinner early and then left. Seriously, he just[r]
did a segment on his show about parents who don't eat dinner[r]
with their kids."[pcms]

*1250|
[fc]
As I placed a glass filled with ice in front of Ren, I[r]
twisted open a bottle of barley tea.[pcms]

*1251|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Maybe next time we should feature Dad's show. 'The Reality[r]
of DHK Employee A!' or something."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="ren_d11"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1252|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0052"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Right now... It's just you and me alone in this house,[r]
right?"[pcms]

*1253|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's right. If Mom were here, we'd always have eggplant[r]
with our somen around this time. We used to get summer[r]
vegetables from Grandpa Myoden."[pcms]

*1254|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0053"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Yeah, um..."[pcms]

*1255|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I want to eat it. Grandpa's eggplants were delicious, but[r]
Mom's eggplant dishes were exceptional."[pcms]

*1256|
[fc]
As I poured barley tea into a glass for her, I suddenly[r]
noticed that Ren's complexion seemed off.[pcms]

*1257|
[fc]
Even though four years had passed, it might still be an[r]
unhealed wound for Ren.[pcms]

*1258|
[fc]
I still can't believe it myself... or rather, I keep feeling[r]
like Mom will come back at any moment saying, "I'm home."[pcms]

*1259|
[fc]
To hide the awkwardness of my insensitivity, I offered Ren[r]
the glass of barley tea I had poured for her.[pcms]

*1260|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well, we may not have eggplant, but there's plenty of[r]
somen, so don't hold back and eat up... Ren?"[pcms]

"That T-shirt, upon closer look, isn't that mine?"[pcms]

*1263|
[fc]
As Ren reached out to take the glass, pushing her chest out[r]
a bit, the silhouette of the "Cassini" logo on her chest[r]
became clearly visible to me.[pcms]

*1264|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I knew it. That's a 'Cassini' T-shirt, right? And black[r]
too... that's super rare!"[pcms]

*1266|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Bah! You don't get it. The T-shirts made for the Cassini[r]
satellite launch came in two colors, black and white."[pcms]

*1267|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"But only a thousand black ones were ever made."[pcms]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"Alright already..."[pcms]

*1278|
[fc]
Reluctantly agreeing, Ren suddenly reached for the hem of[r]
her T-shirt.[pcms]

*1279|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? Wait a minute. Are you planning to take it off here?"[pcms]

*1280|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0061"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"You're the one who told me to take it off quickly."[pcms]

*1281|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Idiot. Who said to take it off here? Wait a second!"[pcms]

*1282|
[fc]
Ignoring my words, Ren attempted to roll up her T-shirt with[r]
vigor.[pcms]

*1283|
[fc]
Luckily hidden by the shadow of the table so her panties[r]
weren't visible, Ren's white belly was exposed.[pcms]

*1284|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Whoa! Wait. I surrender, I surrender!! I was wrong, so[r]
stop!"[pcms]

*1285|
[fc]
Dazzled by the contrast between her translucent skin and the[r]
black T-shirt, I hurriedly stood up to try and stop Ren.[pcms]

*1286|
[fc]
But--[pcms]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"Kyaa!"[pcms]

*1288|
[fc]
Suddenly, something soft touched my palm.[pcms]

*1289|
[fc]
And for some reason, Ren's face was right in front of me.[pcms]

*1290|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? Ah, aaaaaah!! Sorry!"[pcms]

*1291|
[fc]
When I realized what was happening, I panicked and quickly[r]
got up, turning my back to Ren.[pcms]

*1292|
[fc]
When I stood up to try and hold Ren down, by some fluke or[r]
mischief, I had ended up pushing her down hard onto the[r]
floor.[pcms]

*1293|
[fc]
The soft thing that my palm felt was... Ren's breast.[pcms]

*1294|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Sorry. I mean, I didn't intend to touch you, it was an[r]
accident... I'm really sorry!!"[pcms]

*1295|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0063"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"...It's okay, Onii-chan."[pcms]

*1296|
[fc]
Ren's voice came from behind me. It sounded a bit[r]
exasperated, maybe even sympathetic. Or is that just my[r]
imagination?[pcms]

*1297|
[fc]
I sheepishly returned to my original spot and sat down again[r]
in front of Ren.[pcms]

*1298|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Sorry, Ren. I didn't mean to push you down or anything, it[r]
was just some kind of fluke..."[pcms]

"It's fine already. Shall we eat instead? The somen noodles[r]

*1300|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, yeah, that's right."[pcms]

*1301|
[fc]
Feeling somewhat guilty even after hearing Ren's words, I[r]
turned on the TV to hide the awkward atmosphere.[pcms]

*1302|
[fc]
The channel that came on was broadcasting the news, covering[r]
a story about zoo animals struggling with the heat.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="ren_d8"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"Look at the polar bear sprawled out, it's cute."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Is that so?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="ren_d7"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1305|
[fc]
While I wondered why she found that cute, Ren seemed[r]
interested, so I left the channel as it was and we started[r]
eating our dinner.[pcms]

*1306|
[fc]
The commotion had caused the noodles to stretch out a bit,[r]
but as we slurped the still-chilled somen, the zoo news[r]
ended and switched to today's events.[pcms]

*1307|
[fc]
Without bothering to change the channel, the words "Tohoku[r]
Infection Disaster" suddenly caught my attention.[pcms]

*1308|

*1314|
[fc]
Ren answered with a pained expression, and I naturally found[r]
myself reminiscing about what happened four years ago.[pcms]

*1315|
[fc]
Up until four years ago, it was a family tradition for us to[r]
spend our summer vacations in Akita, my mother's hometown.[pcms]

*1316|
[fc]
Mom would go ahead with the three of us kids to Akita, and[r]
Dad would join us later after taking his Obon holiday.[pcms]

*1317|
[fc]
That was always the style.[pcms]

*1318|
[fc]
Yes... It could be said that it was always our style, as if[r]
we had been a single family unit from the very beginning.[pcms]

*1319|
[fc]
In reality, it was only after my mom and dad remarried each[r]
other, each with their own children, that the four of us[r]
started spending time together. Before that, it was just my[r]
mom and me going back to Akita.[pcms]

*1320|
[fc]
I don't know much about my real father, who he was or why he[r]
and my mom split up, because I was too young to remember[r]
anything.[pcms]

*1321|
[fc]
I've heard that Ren's mother was frail, just like Ren, and[r]
passed away soon after giving birth to her. But maybe that[r]
was for the best.[pcms]

*1322|
[fc]
For me, who grew up without knowing my biological father's[r]
face, the man I call Dad is Ren's current father, even[r]
though we're not related by blood. And I suppose it's the[r]
same for Ren with her mother.[pcms]

*1323|
[fc]
Even when our family grew to four people, Grandpa and[r]
Grandma always welcomed us warmly.[pcms]

*1324|
[fc]
And Ren and Dad, originally from Tokyo, quickly grew fond of[r]
Akita as well.[pcms]

*1325|
[fc]
Of course, I also loved spending summers in Akita.[pcms]

*1326|
[fc]
It wasn't a city surrounded by concrete and asphalt[r]
everywhere like Tokyo, but a place rich in nature.[pcms]

*1327|
[fc]
The food was delicious, the people were warm and kind, and[r]
the relaxed pace of life there was almost unbelievable for[r]
the same Japan.[pcms]

*1328|
[fc]
Maybe, even though I was born and raised in Tokyo, the blood[r]
flowing through me matched well with Akita.[pcms]

*1329|
[fc]
And above all, the starry sky seen from the mountain behind[r]
Grandpa's house was the best.[pcms]

*1330|
[fc]
I would lie down on the grassy hilltop and gaze at the[r]
twinkling stars until Mom came to pick me up.[pcms]

*1331|
[fc]
Perhaps my love for stars originated from those starry skies[r]
in Akita.[pcms]

*1332|
[fc]
Of course, once Ren and Dad started coming to Akita, Ren[r]
also joined in on the stargazing from the mountain.[pcms]

;//BG：EV002B
;//<ImageLoad 4,EV002b.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1333|
[fc]
After that, I didn't need Mom to come pick me up anymore; I[r]
would make sure to go home on my own.[pcms]

*1334|
[fc]
After all, Ren would always fall asleep while gazing at the[r]
stars, without fail.[pcms]

*1335|
[fc]
And carrying a sleeping Ren on my back on the way home[r]
became my new routine.[pcms]

*1336|
[fc]
Once we got home, we'd eat the watermelon Grandma had cut[r]
for us and discuss with Grandpa the insect traps we planned[r]
to set up early in the morning.[pcms]

*1337|
[fc]
That was always something I looked forward to... it was very[r]
happy times.[pcms]

*1338|
[fc]
But that year was--[pcms]

*1339|
[fc]
Mom, worried about Grandpa's failing health, decided to[r]
return to Akita alone a bit earlier.[pcms]

*1340|
[fc]
We tried to go with her, but I was too engrossed in the[r]
stars and my grades weren't good enough to get into the same[r]
school as Ren.[pcms]

*1341|
[fc]
I was forcibly enrolled in a cram school's summer course.[pcms]

*1342|
[fc]
Ren didn't need to, but she joined me in attending the[r]
summer course, and we planned to go with Dad during his Bon[r]
holiday break.[pcms]

*1343|
[fc]
Mom went back to Akita on August 5th--[pcms]

*1344|
[fc]
And then the fateful August 6th.[pcms]

*1345|
[fc]
Yes... I think Mom got caught up in that "Tohoku Infection[r]
Disaster."[pcms]

*1346|
[fc]
I really don't know what happened.[pcms]

*1347|
[fc]
After all, since that day, there's been no cell phone[r]
connection, and her life or death, her whereabouts remain[r]
unknown... not even her body has been found.[pcms]

*1348|
[fc]
But considering there's been no contact from Grandpa or[r]
Grandma either, it's natural to assume that all three were[r]
caught up in the disaster.[pcms]

*1349|
[fc]
They must still be alive.[pcms]

*1350|
[fc]
They might come back home any moment now...[pcms]

*1351|
[fc]
Such hope still resides in our family's hearts.[pcms]

*1352|
[fc]
However, considering the extent of the damage and the[r]
survival rate of those involved, it's only realistic to[r]
despair for Mom and the others' survival, and we held a[r]
funeral without a body to come to terms with our feelings.[pcms]

*1353|
[fc]
My kind Grandpa and Grandma.[pcms]

*1354|
[fc]
And my irreplaceable Mom...[pcms]

*1355|
[fc]
The clear air and the beautiful starry sky.[pcms]

*1356|
[fc]
Now unreachable, the precious people I can no longer meet.[pcms]

*1357|
[fc]
Now unreachable, the precious place I can no longer visit.[pcms]

*1358|
[fc]
Four years have passed, and naturally, I feel lonely, but[r]
still, I have my kind father and my cute sister Ren.[pcms]

*1359|
[fc]
So, I'm okay.[pcms]

*1360|
[fc]
I'm okay...[pcms]

Glancing out the window, I saw the dazzling city lights[r]
contrasting with the dark sky where not a single star could[r]
be seen.[pcms]

*1363|
[fc]
If I were to use a clich expression, it would be as if the[r]
stars from heaven had descended to the earth?[pcms]

*1364|
[fc]
The true brilliance of the heavenly stars is hundreds of[r]
times more divine and mystical than these false earthly[r]
stars.[pcms]

"There's no sky in Tokyo... huh?"[pcms]

Someone's words I read somewhere. But truly, there is no sky[r]

I rushed out of my room and knocked on Ren's door.[pcms]

When I tried to open it, I realized that it wouldn't budge,[r]
probably due to its weight.[pcms]

"Hey, Ren. Are you okay? You haven't fallen over, have you?"[pcms]

[vo_ren s="ren0069"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I'm fine... just stubbed my toe a little, that's all."[pcms]

*1380|
[fc]
The voice didn't sound like someone who just stubbed their[r]
toe, but if the door won't open, I can't go in to check.[pcms]

*1381|
[fc]
The voice sounded close for being through a door; probably[r]
because Ren herself was leaning against it.[pcms]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"I'll return your T-shirt later... sorry."[pcms]

[vo_ren s="ren0071"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yeah... I'm fine."[pcms]

*1385|
[fc]
Ren's voice was a bit shaky as if she had hit her toe quite[r]
hard, but despite our earlier stubborn fight, my sister[r]
apologizing so meekly made her seem so dear to me that I[r]
smiled.[pcms]

*1386|
