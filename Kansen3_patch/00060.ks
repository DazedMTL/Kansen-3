"Hmm, hmm hmm hmm~"[pcms]

*1140|
[fc]
I hummed to myself as I drained the boiled somen noodles into a colander and[r]
rinsed off the sliminess with running water.[pcms]

*1141|
[fc]
Even after setting aside a portion for Dad, it feels like there's too much for[r]
just Ren and me... Well, we'll manage to eat it all somehow.[pcms]

*1142|
[fc]
If I add canned fruits like oranges and pineapples, which also serve as dessert,[r]
it somehow looks more luxurious.[pcms]

*1143|
[fc]
As I nodded to myself alone in the kitchen, Dad appeared with his finished[r]
dishes in hand.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan2"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1144|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Thanks for the meal~. Wait, why do you guys get fruit?"[pcms]

*1145|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Didn't you say last time that you didn't like the somen getting sweet if fruit[r]
was added? Something about it being more appropriate for cold buckwheat[r]
noodles."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1146|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"...You could have just served it on a separate plate, right?"[pcms]

*1147|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That would just increase the dishes to wash. Ah, leave that there by the sink."[pcms]

*1148|
[fc]
With a tone of envy and a bit of a sulk, Dad looked at the fruit floating in the[r]
bowl as I coldly responded and started to prepare the condiments for the noodle[r]
dipping sauce.[pcms]

*1149|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"I heard from Ren that we were having curry today. Why somen? It's fine for[r]
lunch, but somen for dinner doesn't sit well with me."[pcms]

*1150|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Can't be helped, right? Ren came down with a fever."[pcms]

*1151|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"You boasted to Ren that you could make curry, didn't you?"[pcms]

*1152|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Of course I can make curry. But I thought it might be bad for Ren's throat if[r]
her fever wasn't from walking around in the daytime but from a cold."[pcms]

*1153|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Oh come on, are you making excuses? ...Well, it's true that Ren is your top[r]
priority. It wouldn't hurt to pay a little attention to your dad too."[pcms]

*1154|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"While you say that, you're about to head off to work, right? Where's the time[r]
to care for a workaholic?"[pcms]

*1155|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Ugh, mmm...you hit where it hurts! I'll do tomorrow's tape check at the[r]
company."[pcms]

*1156|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I've already set up the recording for the fireworks broadcast, and besides,[r]
taking tapes out of the company other than rentals is prohibited."[pcms]

*1157|
[fc]
As I took out concentrated noodle sauce and cold water from the fridge without[r]
looking at Dad, I replied.[pcms]

*1158|
[fc]
Dad is in charge of broadcasting the Oedo Fireworks Festival every year, and[r]
even without that event, he works at DHK, so it's usual for him to head straight[r]
to work when there's a big incident.[pcms]

*1159|
[fc]
Calling him a workaholic might be right in a way.[pcms]

*1160|
[fc]
I'm somewhat envious of my father who can say he loves his job.[pcms]

*1161|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"By the way, wasn't there a documentary you worked on recently?"[pcms]

*1162|
[fc]
I glared at Dad and after a beat...[pcms]

*1163|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Parents Who Neglect Meals with Their Children! The Light and Shadow of Modern[r]
Japan!!"[pcms]

*1164|
[fc]
I wasn't jealous of my father for having the job he wanted, but I deliberately[r]
teased him by quoting the subtitle of a documentary I had seen before.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan2"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1165|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Eh? Oh, ahaha..."[pcms]

*1166|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"The cobbler's children have no shoes, a doctor who neglects his own health,[r]
darkness under the lighthouse!!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1167|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Whoa, I'll borrow the Space Journey DVD for you next time, so please forgive[r]
me!!"[pcms]

*1168|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Boo~! I already have it."[pcms]

*1169|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Oh..."[pcms]

*1170|
[fc]
In an attempt to dodge my barrage of attacks, Dad's eyes shone triumphantly as[r]
he realized I already had the DVD title he blurted out.[pcms]

*1171|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"But what about the Director's Cut edition that just started reservations?[r]
You're saying you have that one, Wataru-dono?"[pcms]

*1172|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? The Director's Cut edition... that includes unreleased footage scheduled[r]
for sale in autumn?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan2"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1173|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Hehehe... Listen well, Echigoya. It's just re-editing the content."[pcms]

*1174|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"The master is already finished; we're just waiting on the package design now.[r]
But you wouldn't want to see it, would you?"[pcms]

*1175|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wowww, my lord~!"[pcms]

*1176|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Humph! Have you realized the power of a father yet?!"[pcms]

*1177|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Haha, my apologies~"[pcms]

*1178|
[fc]
While bowing my head like a corrupt magistrate before an all-powerful badge, my[r]
hands continued to work tirelessly adjusting the concentrated noodle sauce to[r]
make the dipping broth for the somen.[pcms]

*1179|
[fc]
As I poured it into bowls, I glanced at the clock in the kitchen.[pcms]

*1180|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Speaking of which, isn't it about time?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1181|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Oh right. I'm heading out now. It shouldn't be too late... Take care of Ren for[r]
me."[pcms]

*1182|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Roger that. Good luck with work, Dad."[pcms]

*1183|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Yeah. I'll show you a fireworks festival that's better than seeing it live."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*1184|
[fc]
After seeing Dad off with a grin as he left the living room, I placed the somen[r]
and dipping sauce on a tray and headed towards Ren's room.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren, I've brought dinner. Can I come in?"[pcms]

*1186|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0035"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Big brother? Just a moment..."[pcms]

*1187|
[fc]
When I knocked and called out to Ren who should be inside her room, she replied[r]
with an unusually flustered voice.[pcms]

*1188|
[fc]
Along with that came sounds of something being hastily put away.[pcms]

*1189|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm coming in."[pcms]

[evcg storage="EV010a"][trans_c cross time=300]

*1190|
[fc]
After saying a word, I opened the door and saw Ren, who was at least quietly[r]
lying in bed under a towelket.[pcms]

*1191|
[fc]
Her complexion seemed a bit better than in the evening, but her cheeks still[r]
looked faintly red.[pcms]

*1192|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0036"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Geez. You didn't even wait for me to say it's okay before you just came in."[pcms]

*1193|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"You were supposed to be resting, but you were just hurriedly hiding the manga[r]
you were reading in secret, weren't you?"[pcms]

*1194|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0037"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Uh..."[pcms]

*1195|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ahaha. That kind of reaction really does remind me of Dad."[pcms]

*1196|
[fc]
I laughed as I placed the tray beside the bed and peered into Ren's face.[pcms]

*1197|
[fc]
Her purple eyes, usually hidden behind light-blocking colored contact lenses to[r]
avoid strange looks due to her light sensitivity, stared back at me.[pcms]

*1198|
[fc]
In novels and comics, they might be described as violet or amethyst, but the[r]
color of Ren's eyes is so striking that you wouldn't understand unless you saw[r]
them yourself.[pcms]

*1199|
[fc]
No matter how many times I see them, I never get used to them.[pcms]

*1200|
[fc]
Even a poet who could instantly come up with a million eloquent phrases would[r]
only think of the trite word "beautiful."[pcms]

*1201|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0038"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Sorry for making you prepare dinner, big brother. I took advantage today, but[r]
it's not like it's unusual for me to get a fever. You're overreacting."[pcms]

*1202|
[fc]
Her eyes still seemed a bit moist as if she hadn't fully recovered from the[r]
fever, and looking up at me like that stirred my protective instincts, though I[r]
smiled to hide it.[pcms]

*1203|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"If we take 'usual' for granted and it turns out to be a serious illness, that[r]
would be bad, right? Early detection and treatment are key for anything."[pcms]

*1204|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0039"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"But... I don't smell curry. Wasn't dinner supposed to be curry? It's not like I[r]
have a cold; curry would have been fine."[pcms]

*1205|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Huh? I said I could make curry, but think about it, I'm going camping with the[r]
club the day after tomorrow, right?"[pcms]

*1206|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0040"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yeah."[pcms]

*1207|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"The menu for that is curry. If we have curry today, it'll inevitably be curry[r]
tomorrow too."[pcms]

*1208|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Three days of curry in a row is a bit much... That's why I went with somen.[r]
It's simple."[pcms]

*1209|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0041"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Ehh, wasn't it because you were considering my feelings? That's mean, big[r]
brother."[pcms]

*1210|
[fc]
I laughed as I stopped Ren from getting out of bed in a huff and re-covered her[r]
with the towelket that had slipped off her shoulders.[pcms]

*1211|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ahaha. You know I'm just kidding, right? Hey, how's your fever? Has it gone[r]
down?"[pcms]

*1212|
[fc]
As I touched my forehead to hers to check her temperature, despite her moist[r]
eyes, Ren's fever had completely subsided.[pcms]

*1213|
[fc]
I brushed away the hair that had come loose and was entangling her face as I[r]
pulled away from her forehead.[pcms]

[evcg storage="EV010b"][trans_c cross time=300]

*1214|
[fc]
My cheeks relaxed in relief, and seeing that, Ren also smiled.[pcms]

*1215|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Hmm, you should be able to get up and eat now."[pcms]

*1216|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0042"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"That's why I said you worry too much..."[pcms]

*1217|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"If worrying is all it takes to keep you healthy, then I'll worry as much as it[r]
takes, right?"[pcms]

*1218|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Dad said he wouldn't be late tonight, but since he's not here..."[pcms]

*1219|
[fc]
I smiled at Ren who was still a bit sulky and was about to leave her room.[pcms]

*1220|
[fc]
Then--[pcms]

;//<ImageLoad 4,EV008a.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1221|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0043"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"If Dad's out, where are you going to eat, big brother?"[pcms]

*1222|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Where else... probably my room."[pcms]

*1223|
[fc]
I answered Ren's question without much thought.[pcms]

*1224|
[fc]
Eating in the living room would be easier when considering cleanup, but[r]
eventually, I'd have to go down anyway to take care of Ren's finished dishes.[pcms]

*1225|
[fc]
Eating in my own room might actually be more convenient...[pcms]

*1226|
[fc]
I realized this only after answering her question unconsciously.[pcms]

;//<ImageLoad 4,EV008b.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1227|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0044"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Then... I want to eat with you, big brother."[pcms]

*1228|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Right. Your fever's gone down too, and eating alone is bland. Sure."[pcms]

;//<ImageLoad 4,EV008a.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1229|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0045"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"But what about your portion?"[pcms]

*1230|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Oh, mine's still in the kitchen. It'll get cold, so start eating in my room[r]
first."[pcms]

;//<ImageLoad 4,EV008b.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1231|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0046"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Okay. Got it."[pcms]

*1232|
[fc]
I left Ren smiling sweetly as she answered and headed to the kitchen to get my[r]
share.[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=1000][hide_chara_int]

*1233|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Oops..."[pcms]

*1234|
[fc]
As I returned to my room with my set of somen, Ren had just arrived and was[r]
placing her somen on a small table on a tray.[pcms]

*1235|
[fc]
But then again, Ren was only wearing a pair of panties and an oversized black[r]
T-shirt--[pcms]

*1236|
[fc]
The moment I opened the door, Ren's panties were in full view.[pcms]

*1237|
[fc]
I wondered if it was really okay for a girl her age to come over in such a[r]
slightly erotic outfit, even if it was her brother's room.[pcms]

*1238|
[fc]
Well, she must see me not as a man but simply as her brother, innocently adoring[r]
me like when she was a child.[pcms]

[vo_ren s="ren0048"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh?"[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I told you to start eating without me, but you haven't started yet."[pcms]

*1243|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0049"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Yeah..."[pcms]

*1244|
[fc]
While I found Ren's fidgety behavior a bit strange, I placed my portion opposite[r]
her and sat down across the small table.[pcms]

*1245|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"It's been a while, so the ice has started to melt. I brought some more, do you[r]
need it?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="ren_d8"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1246|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0050"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Yeah... I'll take some."[pcms]

*1247|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Hmm... I put too much water, after all. It's causing surface tension."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="ren_d7"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1248|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0051"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Right... Dad's already left, hasn't he?"[pcms]

*1249|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah. He ate dinner early and then left. Seriously, he just did a segment on[r]
his show about parents who don't eat dinner with their kids."[pcms]

*1250|
[fc]
As I placed a glass filled with ice in front of Ren, I twisted open a bottle of[r]
barley tea.[pcms]

*1251|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Maybe next time we should feature Dad's show. 'The Reality of DHK Employee A!'[r]
or something."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="ren_d11"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1252|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0052"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Right now... It's just you and me alone in this house, right?"[pcms]

*1253|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's right. If Mom were here, we'd always have eggplant with our somen around[r]
this time. We used to get summer vegetables from Grandpa Myoden."[pcms]

*1254|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0053"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh? Yeah, um..."[pcms]

*1255|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I want to eat it. Grandpa's eggplants were delicious, but Mom's eggplant dishes[r]
were exceptional."[pcms]

*1256|
[fc]
As I poured barley tea into a glass for her, I suddenly noticed that Ren's[r]
complexion seemed off.[pcms]

*1257|
[fc]
Even though four years had passed, it might still be an unhealed wound for Ren.[pcms]

*1258|
[fc]
I still can't believe it myself... or rather, I keep feeling like Mom will come[r]
back at any moment saying, "I'm home."[pcms]

*1259|
[fc]
To hide the awkwardness of my insensitivity, I offered Ren the glass of barley[r]
tea I had poured for her.[pcms]

*1260|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well, we may not have eggplant, but there's plenty of somen, so don't hold back[r]
and eat up... Ren?"[pcms]

"That T-shirt, upon closer look, isn't that mine?"[pcms]

As Ren reached out to take the glass, pushing her chest out a bit, the[r]
silhouette of the "Cassini" logo on her chest became clearly visible to me.[pcms]

*1264|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I knew it. That's a 'Cassini' T-shirt, right? And black too... that's super[r]
rare!"[pcms]

don't you?"[pcms]

*1266|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Bah! You don't get it. The T-shirts made for the Cassini satellite launch came[r]
in two colors, black and white."[pcms]

*1267|

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"But only a thousand black ones were ever made."[pcms]

Reluctantly agreeing, Ren suddenly reached for the hem of her T-shirt.[pcms]

*1279|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh? Wait a minute. Are you planning to take it off here?"[pcms]

*1280|

"You're the one who told me to take it off quickly."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Idiot. Who said to take it off here? Wait a second!"[pcms]

*1282|
[fc]
Ignoring my words, Ren attempted to roll up her T-shirt with vigor.[pcms]

*1283|
[fc]
Luckily hidden by the shadow of the table so her panties weren't visible, Ren's[r]
white belly was exposed.[pcms]

*1284|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Whoa! Wait. I surrender, I surrender!! I was wrong, so stop!"[pcms]

*1285|
[fc]
Dazzled by the contrast between her translucent skin and the black T-shirt, I[r]
hurriedly stood up to try and stop Ren.[pcms]

*1286|
[fc]
But--[pcms]

"Kyaa!"[pcms]

*1288|
[fc]
Suddenly, something soft touched my palm.[pcms]

*1289|
[fc]
そしてなぜか間近にある漣の顔。[pcms]

*1290|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
「えっ？　あっ、あぁあああああっ！！　ゴメンッ！」[pcms]

*1291|
[fc]
自分の状況に気がついたとき、ボクは慌てて飛び起きて[r]
漣に背を向けた。[pcms]

*1292|
[fc]
漣を押さえつけようとして立ち上がったとき、[r]
何の拍子か悪戯か、ボクは漣を思いっきり床に[r]
押し倒していた。[pcms]

*1293|
[fc]
手のひらにふにっと触れた柔らかいモノは、[r]
漣のおっぱいで……。[pcms]

*1294|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
「ゴメン。そ、その、触る気はなかったと言うか、[r]
　事故って言うか……本当にゴメンっ！！」[pcms]

*1295|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0063"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
「……もういいよ、お兄ちゃん」[pcms]

*1296|
[fc]
漣の声が背中越しに聞こえる。少し呆れたような、[r]
同情してるような声に聞こえるのは、[r]
ボクの気のせいなんだろうか？[pcms]

*1297|
[fc]
ボクはスゴスゴと元の位置に戻り、[r]
漣の正面に座りなおした。[pcms]

*1298|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
「ゴメン、漣。別にボクはその、お前を押し倒すとか[r]
　そう言うつもりじゃなかったんだけど、[r]
　なんかの拍子って言うか……」[pcms]

*1300|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
「あっ、あぁ、そうだな」[pcms]

*1301|
[fc]
漣の言葉を聞いてもなんだかいたたまれなくて、ボクは[r]
気まずい雰囲気を隠すために、ＴＶの電源を入れた。[pcms]

*1302|
[fc]
ついたチャンネルはちょうどニュースを流していて、[r]
暑さに参った動物園の動物たちの話題を取り扱っている。[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=1 chbase="ren_d8"][ChrSetXY layer=1 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1305|
[fc]
なんでこんなのが可愛いと映るんだろうと思いながらも、[r]
漣が興味を持ったようなので、チャンネルはそのままにして、[r]
ボクらは夕飯を食べ始めた。[pcms]

*1306|
[fc]
騒ぎのせいでだいぶ伸びてしまったけれど、まだ冷たさが残る[r]
素麺をすすっていると、動物園のニュースは終わり、[r]
今日の出来事を伝えるニュースになった。[pcms]

*1307|
[fc]
チャンネルを変えるのも面倒で、そのままつけたままに[r]
していたボクの耳に、『[ruby text="エ　ピ　デ　ミ　ッ　ク"][ch text="東北感染災害"]』の言葉が[r]

*1314|
[fc]
沈痛な顔つきで答える漣に、[r]
ボクは自然に４年前の事を思い出した。[pcms]

*1315|
[fc]
４年前までボクたち家族は、夏休みは母さんの[r]
生まれ故郷である明田で過ごすのが恒例だった。[pcms]

*1316|
[fc]
先に母さんとボクら三人で明田に向かい、[r]
後から盆休みを取った父さんが合流する。[pcms]

*1317|
[fc]
それがいつものスタイル。[pcms]

*1318|
[fc]
そう……いつものスタイルと言えるほど、[r]
ボクらは初めからひとつの家族のようにまとまっていたんだ。[pcms]

*1319|
[fc]
実際、４人で過ごすようになったのは、[r]
母さんと父さんがお互い連れ子同士で再婚してからで、[r]
それまでは母さんと二人、明田に帰っていたんだけれど。[pcms]

*1320|
[fc]
ボクの本当の父さんと言う人が、いったいどんな人だったのか、[r]
そしてどんな理由で母さんと別れたのか、[r]
ボクはあまりにも幼かったから何も知らない。[pcms]

*1321|
[fc]
漣のお母さんは、漣と同じような体で病弱だったから、[r]
漣を産んですぐに亡くなったとは聞いた事がある。[r]
でも、もしかしたらそれが良かったのかもしれない。[pcms]

*1322|
[fc]
実の父親の顔も知らずに育ったボクにとって、父さんと[r]
呼べる人は、血の繋がりはなくても漣の、今の父さんだけだし、[r]
漣にとっての母さんもそうだろう。[pcms]

*1323|
[fc]
ボクたち家族が４人に増えても、祖父ちゃんと[r]
祖母ちゃんは温かく迎えてくれた。[pcms]

*1324|
[fc]
そして元々東京生まれの東京育ちだった漣と父さんも[r]
すぐに明田を気に入ってくれた。[pcms]

*1325|
[fc]
もちろん、ボクも明田で過ごす夏が大好きだった。[pcms]

*1326|
[fc]
東京みたいに何処へ行ってもコンクリートと[r]
アスファルトに囲まれた街ではなく、[r]
自然豊かな明田。[pcms]

*1327|
[fc]
食べ物も美味しく、人々は暖かく親切で、同じ日本とは[r]
信じられないほどのんびりとした時間が[r]
あそこにはあった。[pcms]

*1328|
[fc]
たぶん、東京で生まれ育ったけれど、ボクの中に[r]
流れている血が、明田とあっていたのかもしれない。[pcms]

*1329|
[fc]
そして何より、祖父ちゃんの家の裏山から見る星空が最高だった。[pcms]

*1330|
[fc]
ボクは山の上の草原に寝転んで、母さんが迎えに来るまで[r]
いつまでも星の瞬きを眺めていた。[pcms]

*1331|
[fc]
もしかしたら、ボクの星好きはあの明田の星空が[r]
原点なのかもしれない。[pcms]

*1332|
[fc]
もちろん、漣と父さんが明田に来るようになってからは、[r]
漣も裏山での天体観測に加わるようになった。[pcms]

;//BG：EV002B
;//<ImageLoad 4,EV002b.bmp><UpDate Cross,1000>

*1333|
[fc]
それからはボクは母さんに迎えに来てもらわなくても、[r]
ちゃんと家に帰るようになった。[pcms]

*1334|
[fc]
なにしろ、いつも漣は星を眺めている最中に、[r]
いつの間にか眠ってしまうから。[pcms]

*1335|
[fc]
そして眠ってしまった漣をおんぶして帰るのが、ボクの[r]
新しい習慣になった。[pcms]

*1336|
[fc]
家に帰ってからは祖母ちゃんが切ってくれたスイカを食べながら、[r]
祖父ちゃんと朝方に仕掛ける予定の昆虫採集の罠の相談をする。[pcms]

*1337|
[fc]
それがいつもの楽しみで……とても幸せだった。[pcms]

*1338|
[fc]
でもあの年は――[pcms]

*1339|
[fc]
Mom, worried about Grandpa's failing health, decided to return to Akita alone a[r]
bit earlier.[pcms]

*1340|
[fc]
We tried to go with her, but I was too engrossed in the stars and my grades[r]
weren't good enough to get into the same school as Ren.[pcms]

*1341|
[fc]
I was forcibly enrolled in a cram school's summer course.[pcms]

*1342|
[fc]
Ren didn't need to, but she joined me in attending the summer course, and we[r]
planned to go with Dad during his Bon holiday break.[pcms]

*1343|
[fc]
Mom went back to Akita on August 5th--[pcms]

*1344|
[fc]
And then the fateful August 6th.[pcms]

[fc]
Yes... I think Mom got caught up in that "Tohoku Infection Disaster."[pcms]

*1346|
[fc]
I really don't know what happened.[pcms]

*1347|
[fc]
After all, since that day, there's been no cell phone connection, and her life[r]
or death, her whereabouts remain unknown... not even her body has been found.[pcms]

*1348|
[fc]
But considering there's been no contact from Grandpa or Grandma either, it's[r]
natural to assume that all three were caught up in the disaster.[pcms]

*1349|
[fc]
They must still be alive.[pcms]

*1350|
[fc]
They might come back home any moment now...[pcms]

*1351|
[fc]
Such hope still resides in our family's hearts.[pcms]

*1352|
[fc]
However, considering the extent of the damage and the survival rate of those[r]
involved, it's only realistic to despair for Mom and the others' survival, and[r]
we held a funeral without a body to come to terms with our feelings.[pcms]

*1353|
[fc]
My kind Grandpa and Grandma.[pcms]

*1354|
[fc]
And my irreplaceable Mom...[pcms]

*1355|
[fc]
The clear air and the beautiful starry sky.[pcms]

*1356|
[fc]
Now unreachable, the precious people I can no longer meet.[pcms]

*1357|
[fc]
Now unreachable, the precious place I can no longer visit.[pcms]

*1358|
[fc]
Four years have passed, and naturally, I feel lonely, but still, I have my kind[r]
father and my cute sister Ren.[pcms]

*1359|
[fc]
So, I'm okay.[pcms]

*1360|
[fc]
I'm okay...[pcms]

Glancing out the window, I saw the dazzling city lights contrasting with the[r]
dark sky where not a single star could be seen.[pcms]

*1363|
[fc]
If I were to use a clich expression, it would be as if the stars from heaven[r]
had descended to the earth?[pcms]

The true brilliance of the heavenly stars is hundreds of times more divine and[r]
mystical than these false earthly stars.[pcms]

"There's no sky in Tokyo... huh?"[pcms]

*1366|

Someone's words I read somewhere. But truly, there is no sky in Tokyo.[pcms]

All there is are fake skies hidden by the neon lights' splendor.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Looks like I can't love my birthplace like Mom did after all."[pcms]

*1369|
[fc]
All I feel everywhere is a sense of discomfort and alienation, leaving me[r]
empty...[pcms]

The place where my heart can truly rest might have been lost four years ago on[r]
that day.[pcms]

I rushed out of my room and knocked on Ren's door.[pcms]

[fc]
When I tried to open it, I realized that it wouldn't budge, probably due to its[r]
weight.[pcms]

"Hey, Ren. Are you okay? You haven't fallen over, have you?"[pcms]

[vo_ren s="ren0069"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I'm fine... just stubbed my toe a little, that's all."[pcms]

*1380|
[fc]
The voice didn't sound like someone who just stubbed their toe, but if the door[r]
won't open, I can't go in to check.[pcms]

*1381|
[fc]
The voice sounded close for being through a door; probably because Ren herself[r]
was leaning against it.[pcms]

*1382|

[vo_ren s="ren0070"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I'll return your T-shirt later... sorry."[pcms]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"Yeah... I'm fine."[pcms]

*1385|
[fc]
Ren's voice was a bit shaky as if she had hit her toe quite hard, but despite[r]
our earlier stubborn fight, my sister apologizing so meekly made her seem so[r]
dear to me that I smiled.[pcms]

*1386|
