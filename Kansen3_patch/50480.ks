"Well, I have to thank that guy Jin for Mizuki being safe... Annoying as it is."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2530|
[fc]
He added the last part in a mutter, as if spitting it out.[pcms]

*2531|
[fc]
He really doesn't like Jin... But I think it's about time he stopped.[pcms]

*2532|
[fc]
Kousuke himself is seriously picking fights, but from an outsider's perspective,[r]
it just looks like Jin, the adult, is easily brushing him off.[pcms]

*2533|
[fc]
But... for Kousuke, who loves Mizuki, he has to compete even with an opponent he[r]
can't beat. Men are pitiful...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"But well, now that I can see Mizuki again..."[pcms]

*2535|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Ever since we ran away from school, we've been totally relying on Maruko-[r]
senpai, but Mizuki... from now on, I'll protect her!"[pcms]

*2536|
[fc]
"Mizuki alone"... Behind those words, there must be feelings for the many people[r]
he couldn't save. I feel the same...[pcms]

*2537|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Let's do our best, both of us. I have to protect Ren until I can safely reunite[r]
her with dad. I promised Tadahiko too, right?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2538|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Yeah!"[pcms]

*2539|
[fc]
Kousuke cheerfully hums a tune while vigorously lathering up the detergent.[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2540|
[fc]
I can't just relax either, I need to finish cleaning up quickly...[pcms]

*2541|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah..."[pcms]

*2542|
[fc]
The dish I happened to pick up... It was Yuuho's lunch box.[pcms]

*2543|
[fc]
Yuuho...[pcms]

*2544|
[fc]
That's right... I want to protect not just Ren, but also Yuuho.[pcms]

*2545|
[fc]
Yuuho acts cheerfully, but she must be suffering not knowing the safety of her[r]
loved ones.[pcms]

*2546|
[fc]
I can't do much, but I want to support Yuuho by her side... To ease her anxiety[r]
and sadness even a little...[pcms]

*2547|
[fc]
Yuuho's parents... The cheerful and kind owners of Kannagi-ken are probably...[r]
no longer alive.[pcms]

*2548|
[fc]
And Oshima-senpai too...[pcms]

*2549|
[fc]
I wonder if Oshima-senpai and Yuuho were dating... From the atmosphere on the[r]
night of the festival... probably... Or maybe not...?[pcms]

*2550|
[fc]
Ahhh, I remembered it again... I feel so pathetic...[pcms]

*2551|
[fc]
I just thought about supporting Yuuho. I'm the only one who can encourage and[r]
protect her. Why am I still hung up on Oshima-senpai...[pcms]

*2552|
[fc]
Maybe it's because I'm so effeminate that Tadahiko saw right through me and told[r]
me to "get psyched up"...[pcms]

*2553|
[fc]
Right... I need to get psyched up. What matters isn't about me. It's whether or[r]
not I can protect the girl I like.[pcms]

*2554|
[fc]
Even if she doesn't look back at me... A man who is psyched up protects the girl[r]
he loves with his life. Tadahiko would definitely say that...[pcms]

[vo_yuh s="yuho1599"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Good work everyone~"[pcms]

*2556|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yu-Yuuho!?..."[pcms]

*2557|
[fc]
I was so surprised. The very person I was thinking about suddenly appeared.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2558|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"You weren't sleeping?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2559|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1600"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Nope, I was going to sleep, but then I thought it'd be bad to leave everything[r]
to you guys..."[pcms]

*2560|
[fc]
While saying this with a shy look, Yuuho glances at my face.[pcms]

*2561|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2562|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"...I see..."[pcms]

*2563|
[fc]
Suddenly, Kousuke threw the sponge into the sink.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2564|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Nope, Yuuho, that's a good attitude. Since I've clearly finished my part, why[r]
don't you help Wataru out?"[pcms]

*2565|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wait... Kousuke!? When did we decide on parts?!"[pcms]

*2566|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Nope, you worked hard, hahaha"[pcms]

*2567|
[fc]
My protest was ignored as Kousuke walked away waving his hand flippantly and[r]
then stopped for a moment with a sly smile.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2568|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Wataru... get psyched up, okay?"[pcms]

*2569|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh!?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2570|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"See ya."[pcms]

*2571|
[fc]
Without waiting for a reply, he quickly left the kitchen.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2572|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1601"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"...Um..."[pcms]

*2573|
[fc]
Left behind were just Yuuho and me, alone together...[pcms]

*2574|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Ah, yeah..."[pcms]

*2575|
[fc]
Unable to find a way to start a conversation, once again only the sound of water[r]
filled the silent kitchen.[pcms]

*2576|
[fc]
Yuuho usually starts a conversation somehow but seems unusually tongue-tied...[pcms]

*2577|
[fc]
I glanced at Yuuho for a moment.[pcms]

*2578|
[fc]
Seeing Yuuho up close in her tank top and hot pants...[pcms]

*2579|
[fc]
When I look at it like this, hot pants are...erotic. They cling tightly to the[r]
body, highlighting the roundness of the lower belly and the flesh of the[r]
thighs...[pcms]

*2580|
[fc]
It's strange, I've seen Yuuho in a swimsuit occasionally, and I think that shows[r]
more skin. I don't remember feeling this excited...?[pcms]

*2581|
[fc]
Ah, but... I've never been alone indoors with Yuuho in a swimsuit before... so[r]
when I think about it, both situations are erotic?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2582|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1602"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"What's with Kousuke, I wonder?"[pcms]

*2583|
[fc]
Yuuho suddenly spoke up, causing me to hurriedly look away.[pcms]

*2584|
[fc]
No, no, no, if I keep thinking about erotic things... I'll get caught again. I[r]
need to have a normal conversation. Just normally... normally...[pcms]

*2585|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah, maybe Kousuke is..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2586|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1603"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Wait!"[pcms]

*2587|
[fc]
The moment I tried to answer, Yuuho quickly turned back towards the entrance.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h14"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2588|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1604"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"...Don't eavesdrop, okay?"[pcms]

*2589|
[fc]
What? What was that just now? It doesn't seem like she's talking to me...?[pcms]

*2590|
[fc]
After a brief pause...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_d8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2591|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"S-sorry..."[pcms]

;//キャラ消し
[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*2592|
[fc]
I could hear Kousuke's faint voice.[pcms]

*2593|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...You were there, huh."[pcms]

*2594|
[fc]
Really, what is he thinking!?[pcms]

*2595|
[fc]
After searching for a presence for a while, Yuuho turned back to me and started[r]
to speak, "You know..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h16"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2596|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1605"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"...The reason I came back is... not just because I couldn't sleep..."[pcms]

*2597|
[fc]
She cut off her words there and hesitated with her gaze lowered.[pcms]

*2598|
[fc]
...Come to think of it, I feel like I've seen Yuuho like this before... Like she[r]
has something she wants to say but can't quite get it out.[pcms]

*2599|
[fc]
It's unusual for the straightforward Yuuho... Could it be that she finds it very[r]
difficult to say? Did I... do something wrong...!?[pcms]

*2600|
[fc]
As time passed, I began to sweat nervously until finally Yuuho looked at me.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2601|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1606"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I haven't properly thanked you yet. ...Thank you for coming to help."[pcms]

*2602|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh...?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2603|
[fc]
Yuuho's eyes were steady, looking straight at me.[pcms]

*2604|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Yuuho..."[pcms]

*2605|
[fc]
Yuuho is thanking me... She recognizes and appreciates me...[pcms]

*2606|
[fc]
The realization slowly filled my chest and made me ecstatic.[pcms]

*2607|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, of course! After all, you're my childhood friend. It's kind of formal and[r]
awkward to say thanks now, isn't it?"[pcms]

*2608|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Besides, it wasn't just my effort. If it weren't for Maruko-senpai, we wouldn't[r]
have made it this far."[pcms]

*2609|
[fc]
I felt embarrassed and flustered, so I started making up various reasons and[r]
humbly muttered.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2610|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1607"]

"Even so... I was happy. That's why, thank..."[pcms]
;//＠ありがとうと言いかける

*2611|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"It's okay, you've already thanked me. You said it back then too..."[pcms]

"Back then... ah..."[pcms]

[fc]
Yuuho's cheeks turned a sudden shade of red.[pcms]

[evcg storage="EV011g"][trans_c cross time=300]

*2614|
[fc]
Yes, that time...[pcms]

*2615|
[fc]
After rescuing Yuuho, we ended up hugging each other... Her soft body, her[r]
racing heartbeat, and Yuuho's scent...[pcms]

"I... Back then... On the roof, surrounded by those guys... I thought it was[r]
over for me, but I was thinking of Wataru..."[pcms]

I place my hand on Yuuho's shoulder. While maintaining eye contact, I lean in to[r]
get a closer look. My reflection is visible in Yuuho's eyes, which are intently[r]
fixed on me.[pcms]

Right now, in Yuuho's eyes, it's me... Yuuho is looking at me. Only at me...[pcms]

I take another step forward, unsteadily. The distance between us closes. And[r]
then... another step.[pcms]

[fc]
I thought she might reject me, but Yuuho doesn't stiffen up or show any signs of[r]
wanting to back away.[pcms]

But what if... she does look back?[pcms]

What if it's about protecting a girl who gazes back at you?[pcms]

Why are both of them here? Kousuke was supposed to have left after being scolded[r]

I'm amazed at Kousuke for staying hidden (and that's quite something to tease[r]
Yuuho), but why is Ren here too...? What are these two doing...?[pcms]

Kousuke and Ren are bickering and poking at each other. That's not the point,[r]

Breaking the awkward silence, Yuuho slowly began to speak.[pcms]

Remembering the excitement from earlier, I secretly smiled to myself.[pcms]
