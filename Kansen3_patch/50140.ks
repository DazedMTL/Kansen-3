A few minutes later. We were standing in the 1F backyard[r]
passage of the LASER building.[pcms]

Green lights indicating emergency exits were lined up, with[r]
red lights silently blinking alongside them.[pcms]

It seems our intrusion was detected, and the remaining[r]
security system activated, but thank goodness, the emergency[r]
bell didn't ring.[pcms]

"It means there are no security guards."[pcms]

*888|

This place was originally a commercial facility, so it makes[r]

*892|

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Let's go right. There's a booth where security guards[r]
usually station themselves, so we might get some idea of[r]
what's going on. Plus, there's an emergency staircase that[r]
way too."[pcms]

"More escape routes are better. It's decided then."[pcms]

*894|

Following Kousuke's suggestion, we headed right down the[r]
corridor.[pcms]

*895|
[fc]
At the end, we could see the iron door of the emergency exit[r]
that we couldn't enter earlier.[pcms]

*896|

There's also an entrance to the security booth ahead, and[r]
another corridor before that...[pcms]

We pressed our ears against the fire door to try and catch[r]
any sounds from the other side.[pcms]

The small booth that could barely fit one adult was empty.[r]
However, it seemed like the monitors and machinery inside[r]

"The monitors might come in handy at some point. Let's[r]

*907|

The booth protruded partially outside of the building. The[r]
exposed part was covered with reinforced glass so while we[r]
could see out, we were also fully visible from outside.[pcms]

We decided to leave the door slightly open and watch from[r]
