It must be a weird movie that not many people know about, and Senpai, being an[r]
international student, probably doesn't know about those oddly selected movies[r]
shown on TV during the day.[pcms]

*2899|
[fc]
That roadshow doesn't run on holidays or weekends, and serious students would[r]
only have a chance to watch it during long vacations. I can't imagine Senpai[r]
going out of her way to watch it.[pcms]

*2900|

It's only natural for her to make a strange face.[pcms]

*2901|
[fc]
Yuuho must have said that to dispel the creeping anxiety.[pcms]

*2902|
[fc]
For now, Senpai tilts her head and seems unable to think about her worries[r]
anymore, and I'm about to burst into laughter because it's so funny, so I guess[r]
her plan worked.[pcms]

...The old man had... two mouths.[pcms]

One side of his cheek was gaping open with a dark red hole, and a rat peeking[r]

...Of course, he wasn't okay.[pcms]

[fc]
Not just his face. In the center of all the dark red stains on his tattered[r]

A long-awaited date with Yuuho. And when we get home, Ren, Dad...[pcms]

Kousuke and Yuuho's uncle and aunt too... properly...[pcms]

Just as I began to indulge in such fantasies, a scream from our senior snapped[r]
me back to reality.[pcms]

Our senior, who had never let out such screams before, was screaming![pcms]

Our senior's long, beautiful blonde hair was being roughly grabbed and pulled by[r]

This time it was Yuuho's scream!! My firmly held hand was being pulled with a[r]

Yuuho was being pulled away strongly. I gripped her hand tightly and pulled[r]
back.[pcms]

But the force pulling Yuuho was so strong that I ended up being dragged along as[r]
well.[pcms]

Before I knew it, like Yuuho, my bag was being pulled, and I couldn't move.[pcms]

I was pulled to the floor by the hands reaching out one after another.[pcms]

I could only hear this sound for a long time. I can't see. But somewhere behind[r]

I can understand now. That's what that man meant when he said it felt good...[pcms]

...I want to be gnawed on more.[pcms]
