[ns]Jin[nse]
"...If we go by that theory, will we be able to see a golden[r]
ladder descending from the heavens tomorrow?"[pcms]

*3080|
[fc]
I was suddenly addressed and turned around.[pcms]

*3081|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah... did I wake you up?... I'm sorry."[pcms]

*3082|
[fc]
When did he wake up? Jin had his eyes slightly open, looking[r]
this way.[pcms]

[ns]Jin[nse]
"Don't worry about it. But whether it's a curse or not...[r]
the irony is certainly effective."[pcms]

*3084|
[fc]
Jin mumbled to himself in a half-asleep tone, still lying in[r]
the same position as when he was sleeping.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3085|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Well, this city is said to be one of the world's leading[r]
religious cities. There's no other place where so many[r]
different sects gather in such a small area, bestowing[r]
temples and chapels."[pcms]

*3086|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"...There are also traces of ancient Japanese beliefs like[r]
the land gods and Koshin faith..."[pcms]

*3087|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wow..."[pcms]

*3088|
[fc]
I didn't know that. I had heard it was a city where foods[r]
from all over the world come together, but religion too,[r]
huh?[pcms]

*3089|
[fc]
Japanese people really have an open heart, or rather, no[r]
principles at all.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3090|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Well... I don't know which god or Buddha got pissed off,[r]
but having the lid of hell's cauldron open right in the[r]
middle of such a 'blessed city' is not a lovely story."[pcms]

*3091|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's just asking for divine punishment. It's[r]
disrespectful to the gods, isn't it?"[pcms]

*3092|
[fc]
Despite his sleepy tone, Jin's sharp sarcasm made me[r]
instinctively argue back.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3093|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"As for gods... they're nothing more than personifications[r]
of a common consciousness held by people bound by a common[r]
ideology."[pcms]

*3094|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"They are the arbiters of the rules set there. Or perhaps,[r]
the ideal participants who are faithful to the rules, in[r]
their completed form."[pcms]

*3095|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I've never thought of it that way..."[pcms]

*3096|
[fc]
My idea of God is somewhat vague; someone who resides high[r]
above, doesn't help individuals but watches over humanity as[r]
a whole.[pcms]

*3097|
[fc]
Maybe it's not clear because I don't have a religion of my[r]
own.[pcms]

*3098|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"In any case, gods and Buddhas are all about humans[r]
themselves. The limits of gods are the limits of human[r]
imagination, and the limits of miracles performed by gods[r]
are the limits of what human collectives can do. That's why[r]
gods don't know anything that humans can't even imagine."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3099|

[ns]Jin[nse]
"...Similarly, when a worthless two-faced human starts to[r]
become important and raises their voice, they drag others[r]
along with them..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3100|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Gods become worthless two-faced beings too, and the rules[r]
of this world become... full of contradictions and shitty."[pcms]

*3101|
[fc]
Jin continued with a bitter tone, as if spitting out his[r]
words.[pcms]

*3102|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"If such gods willingly let loose those outside from hell,[r]
then perhaps this 'incident' is actually a form of[r]
salvation?"[pcms]

*3103|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Eh...?"[pcms]

*3104|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"If it's a miracle that saves everyone from suffering, then[r]
it makes sense that it started here in Shibuya."[pcms]

*3105|
[fc]
Hell as God's miracle...?[pcms]

*3106|
[fc]
The events happening now and Jin's description were so far[r]
apart that I almost became confused for a moment.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f16"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3107|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1625"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...Salvation?"[pcms]

*3108|
[fc]
Jin stood up from his seat and walked towards us, staring at[r]
the sky as he continued talking.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3109|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Do those outside look like monsters to you? ...To me, they[r]
look just like humans."[pcms]

*3110|
[fc]
Humans, just like that? Those monsters?[pcms]

*3111|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"To me, they definitely look like monsters..."[pcms]

*3112|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"By appearance, yes."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3113|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"But everyone seemed to be suffering with their true[r]
feelings and facades, didn't they? Worried about how society[r]
sees them or how they want to be seen."[pcms]

*3114|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"The virus frees them from various worries and allows them[r]
to be 'themselves'..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3115|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"And those enjoying that state to the fullest are 'them',[r]
right? Don't you think this is what salvation looks like?"[pcms]

*3116|
[fc]
Freedom from worries... being oneself... It seems like a[r]
forced rationalization. Nobody wanted to be infected...[pcms]

*3117|
[fc]
But Jin's words had a strange persuasive power that I[r]
couldn't completely deny.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_f8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3118|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1626"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...You might be right. Then why don't you accept that[r]
'salvation'?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3119|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"It's simple. A story about getting help for free is too[r]
suspicious."[pcms]

*3120|
[fc]
Jin chuckled throatily as if amused and continued.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3121|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Besides, I don't want to do something I dislike just[r]
because everyone else is doing it and it's considered[r]
normal."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3122|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"If being crazy is what they call me for that, then I'm fine[r]
with remaining a crazy guy. I don't want to compromise any[r]
more than this..."[pcms]

*3123|
[fc]
Suddenly his gaze focused on us. Just as I thought so, Jin[r]
shook his head lightly from side to side.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3124|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Shit... I've done it... Drank too much. It's because the[r]
liquor was too good. I've talked too much..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_g2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*3125|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Sorry. I'm going to sleep now, so you two take care of the[r]
rest..."[pcms]

;//キャラ消し
[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*3126|
[fc]
Leaving behind an unusual apology, Jin staggered out of the[r]
dome.[pcms]

*3127|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Salvation... and being oneself, huh..."[pcms]

*3128|
[fc]
I don't need such salvation. But being oneself, huh...[pcms]

*3129|
[fc]
Being oneself... I wonder which one is "being oneself" for[r]
me...[pcms]
