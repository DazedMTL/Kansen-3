"So..."[pcms]

*1200|
[fc]
That's right. I have a gun too.[pcms]

*1201|
[fc]
Even if it's not loaded, I can still intimidate, can't I?[pcms]

*1202|
[fc]
I slowly reach into my pants and grip the handle tightly...[pcms]

*1203|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"D-d-don't move ahhhh!"[pcms]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Whoa!?"[pcms]

*1205|
[fc]
Just as Kousuke was lowering his gun, he reacted to my voice and aimed again![pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1206|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Hm?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1207|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"Eh?"[pcms]

*1208|
[fc]
The two gang members also looked at me with puzzled faces.[pcms]

*1210|
[fc]
Later, I heard from Yuuho that I had completely missed the timing, and my gun[r]
stance was all wrong...[pcms]

*1211|
[fc]
Apparently, everyone thought I had clearly "missed."[pcms]

*1212|
[fc]
But at that time, I couldn't see the situation around me, and I was just filled[r]
with the thought that I had to do something.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=4 chbase="shige_b4"][ChrSetXY layer=4 x=321 y=0]
[ChrSetEx layer=3 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=3 x=-71 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1213|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Um... thank you for saving Mizuki."[pcms]

*1214|
[fc]
I can't back down here... I spoke in as calm a tone as I could manage.[pcms]

*1215|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"But... that doesn't mean I can completely trust you guys waving guns around..."[pcms]

*1216|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"So please answer our questions. Then Kousuke will be satisfied, we can end this[r]
situation, and we can all relax..."[pcms]

*1217|
[fc]
Seeing that no one was responding, I decided to continue persuading a bit more.[pcms]

*1218|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm thirsty, and I'd like to turn up the cooler a bit more. And if we go to a[r]
manga cafe, we can take a shower... Oh, um, even just washing our faces would be[r]
fine..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=3 chbase="jin_c3"][ChrSetXY layer=3 x=-71 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1219|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"...You..."[pcms]

*1220|
[fc]
Jin started to say something with an angry look on his face but stopped mid-[r]
sentence.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=3 chbase="jin_c2"][ChrSetXY layer=3 x=-71 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1221|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"...Fine, I get it. Shige, put that away."[pcms]

*1222|
[fc]
A heavy sigh was heard, and the gun was tucked away.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=4 chbase="shige_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=4 x=321 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1223|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"But, Aniki...!"[pcms]

[chara_int][ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1224|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Put it away!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1225|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"...Okay, understood."[pcms]

*1226|
[fc]
Reluctantly, Shigeyoshi obeyed Jin's words.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

Without taking her eyes off them, Maruko-senpai also lowered her gun in sync[r]
with the gang members' movements.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1229|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*1230|
[fc]
Suddenly, I realized Jin was staring intently at me.[pcms]

*1231|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh... What is it...?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1232|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"How long are you going to point that thing? What's this 'I can't trust anyone[r]
who waves guns around'..."[pcms]

*1233|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah... uh..."[pcms]

*1234|
[fc]
Come to think of it, my gun was still pointed at Jin.[pcms]

*1235|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"S-sorry."[pcms]

*1236|
[fc]
Mumbling an apology, I also put the gun back into my pants.[pcms]
