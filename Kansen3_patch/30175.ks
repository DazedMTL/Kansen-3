No. If that cautious senior went ahead as is, it means this[r]
hatch should be left alone.[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1477a|
[fc]
I hurried down the ladder and chased after the senior and[r]
Ren's group who had gone ahead.[pcms]

*1478|
[fc]
The ceiling was so low that I had to stoop to walk, and the[r]
only light that seemed like electricity was from the[r]
flashlight the senior was carrying.[pcms]

*1479|
[fc]
;The light coming in from the ventilation holes was[r]
dazzling, but it wasn't enough to brighten the entire[r]
passage, so I followed the wall and somehow made it to where[r]
the seniors were.[pcms]

*1480|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senpai, the door has been broken through, and I think[r]
they'll be here soon."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1481|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0202"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"I see. I didn't expect that door to hold up, so it's[r]
anticipated. More importantly, we're going to open this[r]
hatch and get out."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f12"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1482|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Huh? I don't even understand why we're in this place, and[r]
now you want us to go into this hatch? Aren't we going to[r]
get trapped?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1483|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0203"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Then don't follow!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1484|
[fc]
Until now, the senior had been coldly dismissing Kousuke's[r]
complaints, but perhaps having reached her limit, she spoke[r]
out with visible anger.[pcms]

*1485|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Hey, Kousu..."[pcms]

*1486|
[fc]
Gakon![pcms]

*1487|
[fc]
The moment I tried to say something to Kousuke, a sound of[r]
the door being completely smashed overlapped with my words.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1488|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0280"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Being trapped? If we don't escape through this hatch now,[r]
it's the same as being trapped here, right? Kousu-chan?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1489|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Well..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1490|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0281"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Or do you have something against Senpai?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1491|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"It's not that, I just don't like being bossed around[r]
without reason. The condescending attitude pisses me off."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1492|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0282"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Getting pissed off at a time like this and sulking about[r]
it, Kousu-chan's attitude is what's really messed up."[pcms]

*1493|
[fc]
Leaving Kousuke, who was muttering under his breath, to Ren[r]
who was quietly persuading him, I passed by the two of them[r]
and helped the senior who was trying to open the hatch[r]
alone.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f12"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1494|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Worried about Mizuki at a time like this... And yet we're[r]
being taken to such an incomprehensible place... Mizuki is[r]
still in the city."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1495|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0283"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"But even so, do you think you can just rush into there and[r]
make it out just because you're athletic, Kousu-chan?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1496|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"That is..."[pcms]

*1497|
[fc]
Indeed, it seems that Kousuke was particularly irritated[r]
because he was worried about what was happening to Mizuki in[r]
the city.[pcms]

*1498|
[fc]
That's why he had been irritable all along, repeating[r]
actions that weren't typical of Kousuke.[pcms]

*1499|
[fc]
I too... I too am fortunate that Senpai admonished me, and[r]
Kousuke protected me so Ren was saved, but Yuuho...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1500|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0204"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"It's open."[pcms]

*1501|
[fc]
Just when I was sinking into dark thoughts, Senpai brought[r]
me back to reality with her voice.[pcms]

*1502|
[fc]
But an unwelcome voice also followed from behind.[pcms]

*1503|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Man A[nse]
"I smell something nice coming from here?"[pcms]

*1504|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Man B[nse]
"Women... There are women here."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1505|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0284"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eek!"[pcms]

*1506|
[fc]
Startled by the men's voices, Ren let out a small scream.[r]
Although it was hard to see in the dim light, men's feet[r]
were extending through the open hole.[pcms]

*1507|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Let's escape quickly."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]


*1507a|
[fc]
I pointed to the hatch that had just been opened and quickly[r]
guided Ren. The place illuminated by the flashlight looked[r]
like a hole leading to hell, gaping open.[pcms]

*1508|
[fc]
Unlike the ladder we saw earlier, there were concrete stairs[r]
leading underground, so even Ren should be able to hurry[r]
down.[pcms]

*1509|
[fc]
The hatch seemed to close on its own if let go, so Senpai[r]
supported the lid of the hatch until Ren could descend.[pcms]

*1510|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senpai, please go down first. I'll support it now."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1511|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0205"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Is that so? Then..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1512|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Where does this lead to?"[pcms]

*1513|
[fc]
Just as I was about to take over and support the lid of the[r]
hatch from Senpai, Kousuke's voice echoed through the[r]
passage.[pcms]

*1514|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Where it leads... anywhere is fine, isn't it?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f12"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1515|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"How can I go to such an unknown place?"[pcms]

*1516|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Idiot! No matter where this leads to, this is the only path[r]
left for us."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1517|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Wataru, you bastard!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1518|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0285"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Big brother and Kousu-chan stop it. Please let's escape[r]
together, Kousu-chan."[pcms]

*1519|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren is right. Or do you want to rush into those guys who[r]
are about to come down?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1520|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0206"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"If you don't want to go, then don't come. The sister should[r]
go down first. Keep heading straight back."[pcms]

*1521|
[fc]
The light from the flashlight that had been directed at us[r]
was now aimed underground to assist Ren in descending the[r]
stairs, and Kousuke's face became invisible.[pcms]

*1522|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Kousuke"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_j3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1523|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0286"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Kousu-chan! Come here quickly."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1524|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Ah! Damn it all!!"[pcms]

*1525|
[fc]
As if responding to Ren's anguished cry, Kousuke followed[r]
her into the hole, jumping in after her.[pcms]

*1526|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senpai, hurry up."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]


*1526a|
[fc]
After taking over from Senpai who was supporting the hatch,[r]
I urged him to jump into the hole first, and without any[r]
unnecessary talk, he immediately leaped in.[pcms]

*1527|
[fc]
I followed suit, jumping into the hole as well.[pcms]

*1528|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Man A[nse]
"We'll rape the women, eat the men."[pcms]

*1529|
[fc]
[ns]Infected Man B[nse]
"I'm starving."[pcms]

*1530|
[fc]
The voices of the infected were getting much closer. Had[r]
they already come down the ladder?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a8"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1531|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0207"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"I'm closing it."[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=501][hide_chara_int]

;[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1532|
[fc]
The sound of the heavy hatch closing seemed to cut off the[r]
short voice of Senpai and the voices of the men chasing us.[r]
Did we make it? Are we safe?[pcms]

;[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*1532a|
[fc]
*Click...*[pcms]

[se buf=0 storage="se034"]

*1533|
[fc]
The sound of Senpai locking the hatch resonated heavily in[r]
my ears.[pcms]
