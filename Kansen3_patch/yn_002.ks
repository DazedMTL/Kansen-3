How much time has passed since then...?[pcms]

*1423|
[fc]
I've been holed up in my room on the 5th floor, crying[r]
continuously. My eyes and throat are stinging and painful.[r]
But more than that, the pain in my heart feels like it's[r]
going to tear my chest apart.[pcms]

*1424|
[fc]
Ren's remains were wrapped in a blanket and buried in the[r]
same place as the masters. I'm sorry for leaving you alone[r]
in that dark, cold refrigerator... I'm pained just thinking[r]
about how lonely Ren, who hated being alone, must have felt.[pcms]

*1425|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's just... deception..."[pcms]

*1426|
[fc]
Ren can't feel anything anymore. She can't have any[r]
emotions. Because... she's already dead...[pcms]

*1427|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... forgive me... uuuu..."[pcms]

*1428|
[fc]
In the end, I couldn't bring myself to do it. I pushed the[r]
last duty of seeing off my beloved sister onto someone else.[pcms]

*1429|
[fc]
How much she must have wanted to be saved, how much she must[r]
have sought salvation. In the end, Ren, who couldn't rely on[r]
her brother, must have suffered so much.[pcms]

*1430|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I am... I am such a coward...!"[pcms]

*1431|
[fc]
I was afraid of getting hurt myself, I couldn't dirty my own[r]
hands to save my sister, and I ended up abandoning Ren, who[r]
was so important to me...![pcms]

*1432|
[fc]
I was supposed to protect her no matter what. I intended to[r]
defend her at all costs. That's why Tadahiko entrusted me[r]
with a gun.[pcms]

*1433|
[fc]
And yet... Instead of protecting her... I truly abandoned[r]
her... I've lost her forever...[pcms]

*1434|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren... Re-n... ugh, uwooooh...!"[pcms]

*1435|
[fc]
If I had that gun with me, I would have shot myself in the[r]
chest without hesitation.[pcms]

*1436|
[fc]
But perhaps anticipating that, Tadahiko's gun was taken away[r]
by Senior Maruko.[pcms]

*1437|
[fc]
I tear at my hair and beat my chest over and over. If I[r]
couldn't kill myself, then I wanted to be wounded in some[r]
other way.[pcms]

*1438|
[fc]
What kind of punishment would absolve me of my sins? What[r]
kind of pain must I feel to understand Ren's pain...?[pcms]

But right now, I don't want to talk to anyone. Comfort,[r]
sympathy, understanding. I didn't want to receive anything.[pcms]

The call that had once stopped started ringing again.[r]
Reluctantly, I picked up the phone to the incessant ringing.[pcms]

The caller ID showed it was from Yuuho.[pcms]

The scream from Yuuho that seemed like it could burst my[r]
