How much time has passed since then...?[pcms]

*1423|
[fc]
I've been holed up in my room on the 5th floor, crying continuously. My eyes and[r]
throat are stinging and painful. But more than that, the pain in my heart feels[r]
like it's going to tear my chest apart.[pcms]

*1424|
[fc]
Ren's remains were wrapped in a blanket and buried in the same place as the[r]
masters. I'm sorry for leaving you alone in that dark, cold refrigerator... I'm[r]
pained just thinking about how lonely Ren, who hated being alone, must have[r]
felt.[pcms]

*1425|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...That's just... deception..."[pcms]

*1426|
[fc]
Ren can't feel anything anymore. She can't have any emotions. Because... she's[r]
already dead...[pcms]

*1427|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... forgive me... uuuu..."[pcms]

*1428|
[fc]
In the end, I couldn't bring myself to do it. I pushed the last duty of seeing[r]
off my beloved sister onto someone else.[pcms]

*1429|
[fc]
How much she must have wanted to be saved, how much she must have sought[r]
salvation. In the end, Ren, who couldn't rely on her brother, must have suffered[r]
so much.[pcms]

*1430|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I am... I am such a coward...!"[pcms]

*1431|
[fc]
I was afraid of getting hurt myself, I couldn't dirty my own hands to save my[r]
sister, and I ended up abandoning Ren, who was so important to me...![pcms]

*1432|
[fc]
I was supposed to protect her no matter what. I intended to defend her at all[r]
costs. That's why Tadahiko entrusted me with a gun.[pcms]

*1433|
[fc]
And yet... Instead of protecting her... I truly abandoned her... I've lost her[r]
forever...[pcms]

*1434|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren... Re-n... ugh, uwooooh...!"[pcms]

*1435|
[fc]
If I had that gun with me, I would have shot myself in the chest without[r]
hesitation.[pcms]

*1436|
[fc]
But perhaps anticipating that, Tadahiko's gun was taken away by Senior Maruko.[pcms]

*1437|
[fc]
I tear at my hair and beat my chest over and over. If I couldn't kill myself,[r]
then I wanted to be wounded in some other way.[pcms]

*1438|
[fc]
What kind of punishment would absolve me of my sins? What kind of pain must I[r]
feel to understand Ren's pain...?[pcms]

*1441|

But right now, I don't want to talk to anyone. Comfort, sympathy, understanding.[r]
I didn't want to receive anything.[pcms]

The call that had once stopped started ringing again. Reluctantly, I picked up[r]
the phone to the incessant ringing.[pcms]

*1443|

The caller ID showed it was from Yuuho.[pcms]

The scream from Yuuho that seemed like it could burst my eardrums pulled me back[r]
to reality.[pcms]
