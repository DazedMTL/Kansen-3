Upon receiving the news, I rushed into the DJ bar, gasping for breath.[pcms]

*7296|
[fc]
Everyone was already gathered, silently engrossed in the television.[pcms]

*7297|
[fc]
The usual male announcer was on the screen, but his expression was stiff with[r]
fear, and he was sweating profusely...[pcms]

*7298|
[fc]
What's going on? What's happening...!?[pcms]

[ns]Father[nse]
"...I will repeat the information, please listen! This is a shelter in Mouse[r]
Kingdom!"[pcms]

*7300|
[fc]
It's Dad! He was in the middle of a live broadcast.[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=141 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*7301|

[ns]Father[nse]
"At last, an infection by UNKNOWN-LV4 has occurred even in this shelter!"[pcms]

*7302|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Whaaaat!!!???"[pcms]

*7303|
[fc]
I suppressed the urge to scream out loud, covering my mouth and desperately[r]
listening to the voice coming from the TV.[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=141 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*7304|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"Due to the delayed confirmation of the first infected person and the failure to[r]
seal off the facility, the number has rapidly increased, and now almost all[r]
humans in the facility have turned into infected!"[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=141 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*7305|

[ns]Father[nse]
"Currently, the survivors are barricaded inside the facility, waiting for rescue[r]
from the Self-Defense Forces, but we cannot contact each other! Immediate rescue[r]
is urgently needed!!"[pcms]

*7306|
[fc]
The content was terrifying, and Dad's voice was quite tense, but his manner of[r]
speaking was calm and composed.[pcms]

*7307|
[fc]
Maybe Dad alone has managed to hide somewhere out of their reach...[pcms]

*7308|
[fc]
[ns]Announcer[nse]
"Mr. Ayase. Where are you now?"[pcms]

*7309|
[fc]
Perhaps regaining his composure at last, the announcer began to speak.[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=141 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*7310|

[ns]Father[nse]
"I'm at the press center inside the facility! This room is prepared for[r]
journalists from various companies, and the gathered reporters are exchanging[r]
information while considering future measures..."[pcms]

*7311|
[fc]
Suddenly, Dad's voice cut off, and a series of sounds like something breaking[r]
could be heard.[pcms]

*7312|
[fc]
[ns]Announcer[nse]
"Mr. Ayase?"[pcms]

shelter in Mouse Kingdom!"[pcms]

*7314|
[fc]
[ns]Announcer[nse]
"Mr. Ayase!? What happened, Mr. Ayase!?"[pcms]

*7315|
[fc]
Sounds of objects colliding and men shouting at each other could be heard behind[r]
the live audio.[pcms]

[ns]Father[nse]
"...Yamazaki-san. From here on is not a report, but a personal message. I[r]
apologize in advance for using public airwaves!"[pcms]

*7317|
[fc]
[ns]Father[nse]
"...Wataru, Ren, are you listening?"[pcms]

*7318|
[fc]
His tone changed drastically... It was Dad's usual voice for family, not his[r]
professional one.[pcms]

;//[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="otousan1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=141 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*7319|

[ns]Father[nse]
"The door to the press center will be broken soon... I said I would come to get[r]
you, but it looks like I won't be able to keep that promise... Ren... I'm[r]
sorry... Wataru, take care of Ren..."[pcms]

[ns]Father[nse]
"And then..."[pcms]

*7321|
[fc]
Behind Dad's voice, everyone was screaming. Screams and shouts of anger, and[r]
voices saying "They're inside!!"[pcms]

*7322|
[fc]
Suddenly. All too abruptly. The live audio cut off with a "click."[pcms]

*7323|
[fc]
[ns]Announcer[nse]
"Mr. Ayase... Mr. Ayase senpaaaahhh----ahhhhh!!"[pcms]

*7324|
[fc]
The announcer screamed in desperation, throwing away all sense of[r]
professionalism...[pcms]

*7325|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*7326|
[fc]
A heavy silence descended upon the dome. Everyone was stunned into[r]
speechlessness by the shock...[pcms]
