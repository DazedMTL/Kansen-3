I fully understand that it's dangerous to go through the middle.[pcms]

*1135|
[fc]
But when I think about Ren, it seems better to get her into the shade and let[r]
her rest as soon as possible.[pcms]

*1136|
[fc]
I nod to my own thoughts and call out to my senior who is already looking for a[r]
way to climb up onto the roof.[pcms]

*1137|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senior, it seems there's no one on the catwalk, so why don't we go through the[r]
middle?"[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0163"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"No way."[pcms]

*1139|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"But..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1140|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0164"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Can't you hear the voices inside? The inside is already full of them."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1141|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0165"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"It would be wiser to climb directly onto the roof of the gymnasium rather than[r]
descending from the skylight to the catwalk."[pcms]

*1142|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That might be true, but couldn't we sneak by without them noticing?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1143|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0166"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"How are you going to sneak by when the windows aren't even open?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1144|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0167"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Breaking the glass would be like loudly announcing our presence."[pcms]

*1145|
[fc]
When she states it so categorically, it's true that...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1146|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"What's with that? Just because you're a senior doesn't mean you can talk down[r]
to us..."[pcms]

*1147|
[fc]
Kousuke, who was already feeling antagonistic, complained about the senior who[r]
had flatly rejected my suggestion.[pcms]

*1148|
[fc]
But what came back from the senior was a cold gaze.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1149|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0168"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"The catwalk is narrow, leaving no place to hide or escape."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1150|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0169"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"If you're confident you can protect yourself when they corner us, then I won't[r]
stop you."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1151|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"What!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1152|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0252"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Ko-chan! Big brother too... I'm fine, so let's do as the senior says, okay?"[pcms]

*1153|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren..."[pcms]

*1154|
[fc]
Chastised by Ren, I fell silent.[pcms]

*1155|
[fc]
Indeed, as the senior said, even if it seems deserted, the fact that the inside[r]
is overflowing with infected people is true.[pcms]

*1156|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Kousuke, it seems better for us to climb up after all. We can't use ropes like[r]
before, so let's become footholds for each other."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1157|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"What, even you Wataru?"[pcms]

*1158|
[fc]
Kousuke said this with dissatisfaction, but I want to let Ren rest even a[r]
little.[pcms]

*1159|
[fc]
But I know that my judgment, blinded by that concern, is wrong if I think about[r]
it even a little.[pcms]

*1160|
[fc]
Reluctantly, Kousuke nodded silently, and we decided to climb onto the roof of[r]
the gymnasium.[pcms]
