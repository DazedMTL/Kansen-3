The kids are all out to prevent intruders from outside. In[r]
the DJ bar, there's no one but me. All that's here is good[r]
liquor and good music.[pcms]

*4692|
[fc]
How many days, no, how many months has it been since I've[r]
had such a relaxing time?[pcms]

*4693|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
They even have Kagami Beer here. Not bad at all...[pcms]

*4694|
[fc]
The taste in liquor of this place's owner is really good.[r]
All of my favorite brands are stocked here.[pcms]

*4695|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
It's the best...[pcms]

[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
Hey, Aniki! When are we gonna do those brats? It's about[r]
time we do whatever we want with women and food, right?[pcms]

*4697|
[fc]
...Just when I was starting to feel good, this guy...[pcms]

*4698|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
Shige...we finally don't have to kiss up to those bastards[r]
anymore. Don't start with the annoying talk. First off, if[r]
Mizuki starts yapping, that'll be a real pain.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4699|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
That's true, but... But Aniki! If the whole town, no, the[r]
whole world has gone to shit like this, why don't we go wild[r]
and take over the streets for ourselves!?[pcms]

*4700|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
...Don't be so greedy. Shige, calm down a bit. You've got a[r]
thing for that girl Yuuho, right? If you act like a[r]
rampaging bull, she won't give you the time of day.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4701|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
Aniki...stop teasing me...[pcms]

*4702|
[fc]
Shige puffs up his cheeks and sulks like a child. His[r]
expression lacks any charm or age-appropriateness.[pcms]

*4703|
[fc]
But... I can understand why he's bottling things up. His way[r]
of life has always been about brawling every day.[pcms]

*4704|
[fc]
Leaving Shige as he is might be fine, but if "something"[r]
happens, it'll be a real hassle.[pcms]

*4705|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
Hey Shige, you're pent up, aren't you?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4706|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
Eh!? What's up Aniki, you got a girl or something?[pcms]

*4707|
[fc]
Shige's sulky face softens in an instant, turning into a[r]
lecherous grin.[pcms]

*4708|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
Idiot. That's not what I'm talking about. Sports. It's[r]
better to move your body. It's refreshing above all else.[r]
...There's a sports store downstairs. Let's go.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4709|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
...Huh?[pcms]

*4710|
[fc]
Shige stares at me with a face like a pigeon that's been[r]
shot by a bean shooter.[pcms]

*4711|
[fc]
His ever-changing expression slightly soothes my irritation.[pcms]

*4712|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
Heh...I don't hate that part of you. Come on, let's go.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4713|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
What are you saying Aniki...heheh, you saying you don't[r]
hate me means you acknowledge me, right!? Heheh![pcms]

*4714|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
...[pcms]

*4715|
[fc]
...I shouldn't have said anything extra.[pcms]

*4716|
[fc]
Taking the elated Shige with me, I use the stairs to head[r]
down to the lower floor.[pcms]
