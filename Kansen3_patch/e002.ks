The kids are all out to prevent intruders from outside. In the DJ bar, there's[r]
no one but me. All that's here is good liquor and good music.[pcms]

*4692|
[fc]
How many days, no, how many months has it been since I've had such a relaxing[r]
time?[pcms]

`They even have Kagami Beer here. Not bad at all...[pcms]

*4694|
[fc]
The taste in liquor of this place's owner is really good. All of my favorite[r]
brands are stocked here.[pcms]

*4695|

[ns]Jin[nse]
`It's the best...[pcms]

`Hey, Aniki! When are we gonna do those brats? It's about time we do whatever we[r]
want with women and food, right?[pcms]

*4697|
[fc]
...Just when I was starting to feel good, this guy...[pcms]

*4698|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
`Shige...we finally don't have to kiss up to those bastards anymore. Don't start[r]
with the annoying talk. First off, if Mizuki starts yapping, that'll be a real[r]
pain.[pcms]

[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
`That's true, but... But Aniki! If the whole town, no, the whole world has gone[r]
to shit like this, why don't we go wild and take over the streets for[r]
ourselves!?[pcms]

*4700|

[ns]Jin[nse]
`...Don't be so greedy. Shige, calm down a bit. You've got a thing for that girl[r]
Yuuho, right? If you act like a rampaging bull, she won't give you the time of[r]
day.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

Shige puffs up his cheeks and sulks like a child. His expression lacks any charm[r]
or age-appropriateness.[pcms]

*4703|
[fc]
But... I can understand why he's bottling things up. His way of life has always[r]
been about brawling every day.[pcms]

*4704|
[fc]
Leaving Shige as he is might be fine, but if "something" happens, it'll be a[r]
real hassle.[pcms]

*4705|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
`Hey Shige, you're pent up, aren't you?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4706|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
`Eh!? What's up Aniki, you got a girl or something?[pcms]

*4707|
[fc]
Shige's sulky face softens in an instant, turning into a lecherous grin.[pcms]

*4708|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
`Idiot. That's not what I'm talking about. Sports. It's better to move your[r]
body. It's refreshing above all else. ...There's a sports store downstairs.[r]
Let's go.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
`...Huh?[pcms]

*4710|
[fc]
Shige stares at me with a face like a pigeon that's been shot by a bean shooter.[pcms]

*4711|
[fc]
His ever-changing expression slightly soothes my irritation.[pcms]

*4712|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
`Heh...I don't hate that part of you. Come on, let's go.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*4713|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
`What are you saying Aniki...heheh, you saying you don't hate me means you[r]
acknowledge me, right!? Heheh![pcms]

*4714|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
`...[pcms]

*4715|
[fc]
...I shouldn't have said anything extra.[pcms]

*4716|
[fc]
Taking the elated Shige with me, I use the stairs to head down to the lower[r]
floor.[pcms]
