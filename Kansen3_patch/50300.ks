"Alright!"[pcms]

"...is what I'd like to say, but it's impossible."[pcms]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Why not?"[pcms]

*1617|
[fc]
Thinking he had agreement, Kousuke makes a grand gesture of stumbling in[r]
surprise when things don't go as expected.[pcms]

*1618|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's because..."[pcms]

*1619|

I silently take Ren's hand.[pcms]

Ren squeezes my hand back tightly.[pcms]

*1622|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ren and I can't move during the day. In this sunlight, I can't possibly make[r]
Ren walk all the way to the sea. And moving after the sun goes down is out of[r]
the question, right?"[pcms]

*1623|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Besides... I think it's better to stay put, just like Yuuho. It's unsettling to[r]
move around an unfamiliar town in this situation."[pcms]

*1624|
[fc]
I understand Kousuke's point of view, but... I just can't agree with going[r]
outside where they are waiting for us.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_e5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1625|

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"But we can check that with the net or a map, right? If we use Street View, we[r]
can get a pretty good idea of our surroundings."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1626|

[vo_mar s="maru1480"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"However, Wataru has a point. If the route we planned on using becomes unusable[r]
for some reason... If we're suddenly attacked by infected... there's no recovery[r]
from that."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_a2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1627|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho1532"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"And the amount of food we can carry is limited too."[pcms]

*1628|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"And just the thought of being surrounded by infected in an unknown place gives[r]
me the chills..."[pcms]

*1629|
[fc]
After pondering for a while, Maruko-senpai, with a puffed-up face, asks Kousuke.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1630|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1481"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"...This building, it's often used for your meetups and such, right?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_e1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1631|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Huh? Yeah, that's right. It stands out after all."[pcms]

*1632|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"It has quite distinctive features."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1633|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru1482"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"In other words, it's easily designated as a landmark... That means there's a[r]
high possibility it can serve as a sign for rescuers."[pcms]

*1634|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Well, that's one reason why..."[pcms]

*1635|
[fc]
If it's about being in a place that's easy to find, then here is just as likely[r]
as the seaside.[pcms]

*1636|
[fc]
I explained it to everyone in that way.[pcms]

*1637|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Either way, I can't move."[pcms]
