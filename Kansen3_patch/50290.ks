"I agree with Yuuho; I think it's better to hold up here.[r]
It's unsettling to move through an unknown city in this[r]
situation."[pcms]

I understood Kousuke's point, but... I just couldn't agree[r]
with going outside where they were waiting for us.[pcms]

you use Street View, you can get a pretty good idea of the[r]
surrounding area."[pcms]

"However, Wataru has a point. If the route we planned is[r]
somehow unusable... or if we're suddenly attacked by[r]
infected... there's no recovery from that."[pcms]

Maruko-senpai, who had been deep in thought for a while,[r]
asked Kousuke with a puffed-up face.[pcms]

such, right?"[pcms]

all."[pcms]

"In other words, it's easily designated as a landmark...[r]
That means there's a high possibility it could serve as a[r]
sign for rescuers."[pcms]

*1610|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah. That's why... I think it's better not to move."[pcms]

*1611|
[fc]
If it's about being in a place that's easy to find, then[r]
here is just as likely as anywhere by the sea.[pcms]

*1612|
[fc]
I explained it to everyone like that.[pcms]
