"Sorry... Yuuho..."[pcms]

*6199|
[fc]
I find myself apologizing again.[pcms]

*6200|
[fc]
The previous "sorry" was for the clumsy kiss, but this[r]
time... it's different...[pcms]

*6201|
[fc]
Somehow, I feel like I've hurt Yuuho by prioritizing my own[r]
desires in such a moment...[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Yu, Yuuho...?"[pcms]

*6206|
[fc]
Surprised by the quiet anger in her voice, I look at her[r]
face.[pcms]

*6207|
[fc]
Yuuho, with tears in her eyes, glares at me and roughly[r]
yanks off her earphones.[pcms]

*6208|
[fc]
Huh...? Yuuho... is she angry...? Not about the kiss, but[r]
because I apologized...?[pcms]

*6209|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wh-why, well... there's no deep meaning, but, ah, it's not[r]
like I haven't thought about it, just..."[pcms]

*6210|
[fc]
In my confusion, I open my mouth feeling I have to say[r]
something.[pcms]

*6211|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yu, Yuuho is going through a tough time right now, or[r]
rather, ah... of course, it's tough for everyone, but[r]
just..."[pcms]

*6212|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"In Yuuho's case... losing family and loved ones... Ah,[r]
family is, well, still unknown, but, um, people like Oshima-[r]
senpai too..."[pcms]

*6213|
[fc]
Ah, this is no good. I'm stumbling over my words with zero[r]
persuasiveness... I can't even understand what I'm saying[r]
anymore...[pcms]
