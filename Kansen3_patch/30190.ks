I know the gym is full of infected, and they came this way[r]
because there's no escape, using the human ladder.[pcms]

*1670|
[fc]
So really, there's no need to hesitate, I should choose the[r]
rope.[pcms]

*1671|
[fc]
But...[pcms]

*1672|
[fc]
The simulation of pulling Yuuho over here with the rope[r]
played in my mind.[pcms]

*1673|
[fc]
It would mean getting quite close to the gym windows where[r]
the infected are swarming.[pcms]

*1674|
[fc]
When I peeked through the skylight, the catwalk seemed[r]
empty, but I can't be sure if it's the same here.[pcms]

*1675|
[fc]
Besides, the skylight isn't just a window that a person can[r]
barely pass through, it's forbidden, but it's big enough[r]
that some people use it to go in and out of the corridor[r]
roof.[pcms]

*1676|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Would it be better to go help directly from inside the[r]
gym? It's a detour, but"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1677|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Yeah. It might be a roundabout way, but that seems most[r]
certain. There's no rope to descend with either..."[pcms]

*1678|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Above all, if we carelessly approach the window and they're[r]
inside, Yuuho will just become prey if she's alone, right?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1679|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0293"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"That's... right. We need to hurry and save Yuuho-chan."[pcms]

*1680|
[fc]
Having agreed with Ren and Kousuke, I turned towards the[r]
senior.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f9"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1681|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Alright, I'll go too."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1682|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0214"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"More importantly, is your sister's condition okay?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1683|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0294"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"Eh?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1684|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0215"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Since we're going to the branch school building anyway. How[r]
about resting in the rooftop biotope garden?"[pcms]

*1685|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Biotope garden?"[pcms]

*1686|
[fc]
Why there?[pcms]

*1687|
[fc]
...That question rose to my throat. But indeed, I agreed[r]
with letting Ren rest.[pcms]

*1688|
[fc]
She's quietly held in Kousuke's arms, but Ren's condition is[r]
visibly bad enough that she's trying to look strong.[pcms]

*1689|
[fc]
Looking at Kousuke's face for his opinion, he seemed to[r]
share my thoughts, his expression plastered with question[r]
marks.[pcms]

*1690|
[fc]
Still, he must know best how hot Ren's body is since he's[r]
holding her. He seemed to agree with letting her rest and[r]
didn't get entangled with the senior.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1691|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0295"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I-I'm fine... Kousuke-chan, put me down."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1692|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Are you really okay? Truly?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i7"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1693|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0296"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"I'm fine."[pcms]

*1694|
[fc]
Saying so, Ren descended from Kousuke's arms onto the gym[r]
roof.[pcms]

*1695|
[fc]
But her footing was a little unsteady.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i6"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1696|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0297"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"See? I'm fine, right?"[pcms]

*1697|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"You're not fine, right? Come on, let's head to the biotope[r]
anyway."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1698|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"The entrance to the biotope is usually left unlocked, and[r]
maybe you can rest inside, right?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="ren_i5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=185 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1699|
[fc]
[vo_ren s="ren0298"]
[ns]Ren[nse]
"But..."[pcms]

*1700|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's right. Ren should rest in the shade for a bit. The[r]
UV cream has worn off too."[pcms]

*1701|
[fc]
While steadying Ren's staggering body, I said that and[r]
turned back to Yuuho again.[pcms]

*1702|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yuuho, can you wait just a little longer?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1703|
[fc]
[vo_yuh s="yuho0150"]
[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Y-Yes. I'm fine. It feels wrong to have you come save me,[r]
but I can wait."[pcms]

*1704|
[fc]
Despite her own perilous situation, Yuuho bravely smiled and[r]
answered me.[pcms]

*1705|
[fc]
Feeling a bit moved by her kindness and strength, I took Ren[r]
by the hand and chased after the senior heading towards the[r]
branch school building.[pcms]

"Then I'll transport the important violin first. Yo! And..."[pcms]

;//キャラ消し
[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*1707|
[fc]
After receiving the violin case from Ren, Kousuke lightly[r]
dashed across the gym roof and jumped over to the biotope[r]
garden ahead of us.[pcms]

*1708|
[fc]
It's not like the gap is wide enough to need a dash. At most[r]
it's about one meter.[pcms]

*1709|
[fc]
If Ren were in normal condition, she could barely make the[r]
jump.[pcms]

*1710|
[fc]
From here, Yuuho was out of sight, but through the gaps, I[r]
could see infected milling about, and Ren's condition was[r]
not normal.[pcms]

*1711|
[fc]
Moreover, we were on a roof almost as high as a three-story[r]
building. Could we make the jump successfully...?[pcms]

*1712|
[fc]
Looking at Ren's face, her cheeks were redder than before[r]
and it was clear her fever had risen significantly.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_f1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1713|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Ren-chan can't make this jump now, right? Can't we pass her[r]
over between us two?"[pcms]

*1714|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"That's a good idea, Kousuke."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"If you feel bad about it, then you should just rest[r]
quietly. Here, drink some sports drink and wait."[pcms]

*1717|
[fc]
I took out a water bottle from my backpack pocket and handed[r]
it to Ren, then I picked her up in my arms.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Be careful, okay?"[pcms]

*1719|
[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"I understand... you're going to help us?"[pcms]

*1720|
[fc]
The senior who had been watching offered to help pass Ren to[r]
Kousuke.[pcms]

[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Because you guys alone aren't reliable. Make sure to get[r]
your sister across to the garden properly."[pcms]

*1722|
[fc]
Kousuke made a slightly annoyed face at the senior's blunt[r]
words.[pcms]

*1723|
[fc]
But perhaps grateful for the help, he didn't say anything[r]
and accepted Ren's body.[pcms]

here."[pcms]

"That's right. It's better to get into the shade quickly...[r]

it'll be easier to help Yuuho-chan, won't it?"[pcms]

[ns]Ren[nse]
"Please take care of my brother."[pcms]

*1735|
[fc]
Kousuke seemed like he wanted to say something to the senior[r]
who smiled slyly, but Ren bowed her head first, and it[r]
seemed to take the fight out of him.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senior, there's a maintenance ladder for the roof over[r]
here. We can get to the emergency exit that leads to the[r]
gymnasium from here."[pcms]

*1738|
[fc]
As I ran a little towards the ladder and was about to[r]
descend first, I met Ren's eyes, which were looking at me[r]
with concern.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'll definitely come back with Yuuho."[pcms]

I smiled back at Ren's words and descended the ladder to the[r]

*1742|
[fc]
This should be the emergency exit behind the gym teacher's[r]
office... I hope it's open.[pcms]

*1743|
[fc]
The doorknob I turned didn't budge at all, and as expected,[r]
it seemed to be locked.[pcms]

*1744|
[fc]
What should I do?[pcms]

*1745|
[fc]
I don't have the key for this place, should I go down the[r]
emergency stairs and try from the first floor?[pcms]

*1746|
[fc]
As I was thinking this, the senior came down beside me.[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yes. If we get through here, we can reach the gym teacher's[r]
office... wait, Senior!?"[pcms]

*1749|
[fc]
While I was explaining, the senior took a karate stance or[r]
something and took a deep breath.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a7"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

But this wasn't the time to worry about such things.[pcms]

I went through the opened door and entered the gymnasium.[pcms]
