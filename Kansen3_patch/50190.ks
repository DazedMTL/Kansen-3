"Calm down... calm down, me..."[pcms]

*1238|
[fc]
If I don't do something, we're heading straight into a[r]
bloodbath of screams and chaos.[pcms]

*1239|
[fc]
I need to stay calm and persuade them... to peacefully[r]
resolve this situation...[pcms]

*1240|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Um... excuse me, may I have a moment?"[pcms]

*1241|
[fc]
Breaking through the tense atmosphere, I hesitantly start to[r]
speak.[pcms]

[ns]Jin[nse]
"Hmm?"[pcms]

*1243|
[fc]
I was glared at by Jin...! It was so scary that the hairs on[r]
the back of my neck stood up.[pcms]

*1244|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Ah, um... thank you for saving Mizuki."[pcms]

*1245|
[fc]
But I can't back down here... I spoke as calmly as I could.[pcms]

*1246|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"However... that doesn't mean I can completely trust you[r]
guys who are waving guns around..."[pcms]

*1247|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"So please answer our questions. If you do, Kousuke will be[r]
satisfied, we can end this situation, and all relax[r]
together..."[pcms]

*1248|
[fc]
Seeing that no one was responding, I decided to continue[r]
trying to persuade them.[pcms]

*1249|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I'm thirsty, and I'd like to turn up the cooler a bit more.[r]
And if we go to a manga cafe, we can even take showers...[r]
Ah, um, just washing our faces would be fine too..."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1250|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"...You..."[pcms]

*1251|
[fc]
Jin started to say something but stopped, his face angry.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1252|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"...Fine, I get it. Shige, put that away."[pcms]

*1253|
[fc]
A heavy sigh was heard, and the gun was tucked away.[pcms]

[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"But, Aniki...!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1255|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"Put it away!"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1256|
[fc]
[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"...Okay, understood."[pcms]

*1257|
[fc]
Reluctantly, Shigeyoshi obeyed Jin's words.[pcms]

Without taking her eyes off the scene, Maruko-senpai also[r]
lowered her gun in sync with their movements.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1260|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"..."[pcms]

*1261|
[fc]
Before I knew it, Jin was staring intently at me.[pcms]

*1262|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Eh... what is it...?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1263|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"...I've lost my edge."[pcms]

*1264|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Huh?"[pcms]

*1265|
[fc]
The expression on Jin's face... what is this...? Could it[r]
be... he's dumbfounded...?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_c4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*1266|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"To ask for a 'stronger cooler' in this situation...? You've[r]
got some unusual nerves..."[pcms]

*1267|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"I... I'm sorry."[pcms]

*1268|
[fc]
Now that he mentions it... maybe that was foolish of me...?[pcms]

*1269|
[fc]
Feeling my cheeks turn red, I mumbled to myself.[pcms]
