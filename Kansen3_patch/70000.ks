"Alright everyone, good work! Lunch is a special vegetable[r]
stir-fry today!"[pcms]

[fc]
The lunch menu consisted of rice, miso soup, meat and[r]
vegetable stir-fry, salad, and omelet.[pcms]

*3|
[fc]
It seems Yuuho was eager to cook because she got her hands[r]
on some fresh vegetables and eggs.[pcms]

Like my senior, I didn't say it out loud, but I was also[r]
inwardly relieved.[pcms]

Everyone joined in the greeting and then started eating[r]
their meals.[pcms]

As soon as she tasted the meat and vegetable stir-fry,[r]
Margarita immediately grabbed Yuuho's hand.[pcms]

"Don't fuss over appearances, compete with flavor! That way[r]
you can become a first-class chef, right?"[pcms]

[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"Ah... is that so..."[pcms]

*15|
[fc]
With a complicated expression on her face, Yuuho gave a wry[r]
smile.[pcms]

*16|
[fc]
Kousuke is shoveling rice into his mouth with incredible[r]
speed, and it looks like Mizuki won't have any trouble with[r]
this menu either.[pcms]

*17|
[fc]
I wonder what the vegetarians will do...?[pcms]

*18|
[fc]
Looking over, I saw that Jin-san had a plate of meatless[r]
vegetable stir-fry in front of him.[pcms]

*19|
[fc]
The special meat and vegetable stir-fry from Kannagi-ken is[r]
amazing for its juicy vegetables' crispness; it's one of my[r]
favorite dishes too...[pcms]

*20|
[fc]
I wonder if it's still delicious without the meat...?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*21|
[fc]
[ns]Jin[nse]
"...It's delicious. The balance of spicy miso and oil is[r]
perfect. And the salad is good too. It was worth the work."[pcms]

*22|
[fc]
Explaining to me who was watching, Jin-san continued to eat[r]
steadily.[pcms]

*23|
[fc]
Of course... there's a portion prepared for Ren too, but[r]
she's still asleep as usual and nowhere to be seen.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="mizu_b4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=160 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"...Ren... she still hasn't woken up? Is she really feeling[r]
that bad?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"It's definitely a bit worrying..."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah. I'll bring her some medicine later."[pcms]

[black_toplayer][trans_c cross time=1000][hide_chara_int]

Despite our worries, the meal was delicious... We finished[r]
lunch in a pleasant atmosphere.[pcms]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"...Ah, I'm stuffed."[pcms]

*29|
[fc]
Kousuke, whose stomach had visibly expanded before and after[r]
the meal, stretched out and sprawled over his chair.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_c1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[fc]
[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"So, what are we doing after this? Oh, Wataru will go visit[r]
her first, right?"[pcms]

*31|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Yeah... since we've finished moving stuff and there's no[r]
news."[pcms]

*32|
[fc]
The updates on the mobile site aren't that frequent either,[r]
so there doesn't seem to be any need to rush to check it.[pcms]

*33|
[fc]
We discussed various things and decided to spend the[r]
afternoon looking around the shops inside LASER.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_c11"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

check out any good equipment while I'm at it..."[pcms]

[vo_miz s="mizuki_RK0002"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"I'll join you, Kousuke."[pcms]

*36|
[fc]
Considering he had been fussing about "Tengu-dou!" since day[r]
one, he probably won't return for a while once he goes[r]
there...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*37|

[ns]Jin[nse]
"...I'll take a look around the fourth floor."[pcms]

*38|
[fc]
The fourth floor is home to the large analog record shop[r]
'Recomani'.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_c1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*39|

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Huh? You're interested in music too?"[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="jin_h2"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=144 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"That's not my main purpose."[pcms]

[vo_miz s="mizuki_RK0003"]
[ns]Mizuki[nse]
"Jin likes movies and dramas quite a bit, right?"[pcms]

*42|
[fc]
Indeed 'Recomani' mainly sells analog records but they also[r]
sell CDs and DVDs.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="shige_b4"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Shigeyoshi[nse]
"...I'll pass. I'm completely worn out from being worked to[r]
the bone. Now that I've eaten, let me sleep."[pcms]

*44|
[fc]
Despite saying he wanted to sleep, Shigeyoshi left with a[r]
load of items including bottles of liquor, snacks,[r]
magazines, and headed to the VIP room. Even after such a big[r]
lunch, is his stomach still not satisfied...?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="yuho_h5"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=164 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Yuuho[nse]
"I think I'll go to 'Staybucks'. I want a latte, so I need[r]
to learn how to make one..."[pcms]

*46|
[fc]
That means Yuuho is heading to the B1 floor...[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_d1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"Then I shall go to the third floor. I might find something[r]
useful there."[pcms]

*48|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai seems to be aiming for the military shop[r]
'Tokyo Ghost'.[pcms]

*49|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"So we're all splitting up then."[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_c1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

[ns]Kousuke[nse]
"Let's just meet up later whenever."[pcms]

*51|
[fc]
I decided to bring nutritional supplements and mineral water[r]
for Ren.[pcms]
