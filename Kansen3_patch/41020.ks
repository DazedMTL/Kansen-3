Despite having cried just moments ago, Yuuho is already speaking with a cheerful[r]
voice. Perhaps she feels refreshed from crying, just as the senior said? Her[r]
brightness is supporting me.[pcms]

I apologize again to the senior who looks at me with an exasperated expression.[pcms]

The image of Hiko-chin pops into my head.[pcms]

*2397|

...I wonder if Hiko-chin and Inori-san are okay?[pcms]

"It's just an example. Be brief, clear, easy to understand, easy to remember.[r]
And add humor."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Humor? You mean to include a joke?"[pcms]

[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0313B"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"That's one way, but self-introductions are about asserting who you are and what[r]
makes you different from others. In other words, individuality."[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"No, not at all..."[pcms]

*2407|
[fc]
Yuuho and I struggle to suppress our laughter that's threatening to burst out.[pcms]

*2408|
[fc]
The dignified senior suddenly seems cute. Maybe this is the "humor" she was[r]
talking about?[pcms]

I'm in the astronomy club. ...Please call me Wataru."[pcms]

As expected, my introduction ends in a single sentence.[pcms]

*2417|

I respond loudly to the senior who mentioned a talent I had even forgotten about[r]
myself.[pcms]

[fc]
Having finished our introductions anew, we were checking our belongings at the[r]
suggestion of Maruko-senpai... Margarita.[pcms]

*2420|
[fc]
Of course, everyone had their bags ready, and they all had a change of clothes.[pcms]

*2421|
[fc]
Everyone has athletic clothes and uniforms for their own reasons.[pcms]

*2422|
[fc]
Yuuho is wearing a jersey over her swimsuit, which is a bit inadequate, so[r]
during this short break, she's changing into her uniform behind some cover. It's[r]
quite an effort not to look that way...[pcms]

*2423|
[fc]
Maruko-senpai, for some reason, has a safari jacket and safari pants as her[r]
change of clothes.[pcms]

*2424|
[fc]
I wonder why senpai has such clothes for changing?[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"We also have plenty of light... It's reassuring since we'll be moving[r]
underground for a while."[pcms]

;//@konya char_clear
[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*2426|
[fc]
In addition to my LED electric lantern, senpai has three small lights.[pcms]

*2427|
[fc]
Seeing that they're all different shapes suggests they're for different[r]
purposes.[pcms]

*2428|
[fc]
Besides the lights, there are senpai's and my digital cameras. Yuuho's and my[r]
cell phones can also serve as lights for a short time.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"It looks like we have enough water to last us for about two days..."[pcms]

[chara_int_ layer=5][trans_c cross time=150]

*2430|
[fc]
The most important thing for survival, water, was something all of us had in the[r]
form of sports drinks. Senpai also had a little bit of regular water.[pcms]

*2431|
[fc]
As for food, Yuuho and I had brought snacks. In addition to that, I have canned[r]
food and a lunch box given to me by Ren. I need to eat this lunch box first.[pcms]

*2432|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...Thank you, Ren."[pcms]

*2433|
[fc]
Naturally, words of gratitude slipped out.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2434|

[vo_mar s="maru0322"]
[ns]Margarita[nse]
"Even so, Wataru, you brought quite a lot of stuff with you..."[pcms]

*2435|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"It was for the Astronomy Club camp..."[pcms]

*2436|
[fc]
Various chemicals, trash bags, dishes, knives, towels, a radio... There's even[r]
something called a "cool sheet" that I'm not sure will be useful, but it's[r]
supposed to keep you cool when you lay it over you.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="maru_a1"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=147 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

*2437|
[fc]
[vo_mar s="maru0323"]

"Once again, Wataru's Astronomy Club has proven to be useful."[pcms]

While gripping the mop that has been our weapon since we escaped the academy,[r]
senpai said this, and I couldn't help feeling happy again.[pcms]
