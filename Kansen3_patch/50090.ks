After climbing the narrow staircase, we passed the 2nd floor shop, the 3rd floor[r]

I suddenly remembered. I'm sure that in this closet... the ceiling panel in the[r]

As I climbed up to the top shelf of the closet and rummaged around, my senior[r]

"Ah... I heard from Hiko-chin. There's supposed to be something 'useful' here."[pcms]

[chara_int][trans_c cross time=150]

*624|

The panel came off easily.[pcms]

*625|
[fc]
I set it aside and peered into the ceiling space.[pcms]

*626|
[fc]
It was dim and hard to see, but I could tell there were two cardboard boxes[r]
placed nearby.[pcms]

And... there were several long objects near the boxes...[pcms]

I reached out and pulled them closer...[pcms]

[ns]Wataru[nse]
"...!? B-blades!?"[pcms]

*631|
[fc]
Swords and daggers were carelessly tossed aside.[pcms]

[vo_mar s="maru1334"]

My senior snatched a Japanese sword from me as if grabbing it away and[r]
unsheathed it, holding it up in front of her.[pcms]

"What a clear and brilliant shine... The splendid curve of the blade... And the[r]

*636|

With her eyes wider than usual, my senior peered closely at the blade, muttering[r]
to herself as she examined it.[pcms]

[ChrSetEx layer=5 chbase="kou_e3"][ChrSetXY layer=5 x=161 y=0][trans_c cross time=150]

"More importantly, Kousuke, I'm going to lower the boxes, so catch them for me."[pcms]

[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Wha... What's this!?"[pcms]

Inside were three handguns, a box that seemed to contain bullets, and...[r]

[fc]
...What are you talking about, Kousuke-kun?[pcms]

Ignoring Kousuke who was unnecessarily excited by the guns, I was concerned[r]
about the Japanese sword Maruko-senpai was holding.[pcms]

*656|
[fc]
[ns]Wataru[nse]
"Senpai, are you going to use that Japanese sword?"[pcms]

*657|
[fc]
I had received a gun from Hiko-chin but still didn't have the confidence to[r]
handle it.[pcms]

*658|
[fc]
If senpai was going to use a Japanese sword, maybe I should choose a dagger or[r]
something as my weapon. That's what I briefly considered.[pcms]

While making excuses in a somewhat regretful tone, Maruko-senpai slowly sheathed[r]
the sword back into its scabbard.[pcms]

Being careful not to be seen from the street, I cautiously peered down right[r]
below the building.[pcms]

The gap between "LASER" and "Dedepou" is literally a 'valley' between buildings,[r]
about two meters wide.[pcms]

But in that gap, there's a wall with a back door that separates it from the main[r]
street.[pcms]

The wall isn't very tall but it's made of metal so it's sturdy, and there's no[r]
worry of it being broken. In other words... the infected can't get in.[pcms]
